title: Design & Implementation Audit
description: Comprehensive design quality analysis of packages/ui and apps/web covering color, typography, spacing, components, responsiveness, and visual patterns
---

## Executive Summary

The Roxabi Boilerplate ships a solid design foundation built on shadcn/ui conventions, OKLch color space, Radix UI primitives, and Tailwind CSS 4. The component library (`packages/ui`) is well-structured and follows modern best practices. However, several areas would benefit from targeted improvements to reach the level of best-in-class products like Vercel's dashboard, Linear, or Stripe.

**Overall grade: B+** -- Strong engineering foundation, good accessibility baseline, but missing polish and density refinements that separate "good boilerplate" from "world-class design system."

---

## 1. Design System Audit

### 1.1 Color Palette

**Strengths:**
- Uses OKLch color space (perceptually uniform) -- a genuinely advanced choice. Most design systems still use HSL or raw hex.
- Full light/dark mode support with 75+ CSS custom properties.
- 21 theme presets (4 base + 17 color) sourced from shadcn registry.
- Built-in WCAG AA contrast checking via `contrastRatio()` and `meetsWcagAA()` in `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/packages/ui/src/lib/theme.ts` (lines 166-181).
- Theme derivation engine automatically generates foreground colors, chart colors, sidebar variants from 8 seed colors.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| IMPORTANT | Default theme has identical `secondary`, `muted`, and `accent` values | `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/packages/ui/src/theme.css` lines 16-19 | All three are `oklch(0.967 0.001 286.375)` in light mode. This means secondary buttons, muted text backgrounds, and accent states are visually indistinguishable. Users cannot differentiate between these semantic roles. |
| IMPORTANT | `destructive-foreground` in light mode equals the destructive color itself | `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/packages/ui/src/theme.css` line 22 | `--destructive-foreground: oklch(0.577 0.245 27.325)` is identical to `--destructive: oklch(0.577 0.245 27.325)`. This means text styled with `text-destructive-foreground` on a `bg-destructive` background would be invisible. The Badge component works around this by hardcoding `text-white` for destructive variant. |
| POLISH | Ring color differs between `theme.css` and Zinc preset in `presets.ts` | `theme.css` line 25 vs `presets.ts` line 50 | `theme.css` uses `oklch(0.871 0.006 286.286)` while the Zinc preset in `presets.ts` uses `oklch(0.705 0.015 286.067)`. The file that ships as the stylesheet default and the programmatic preset are out of sync. |
| POLISH | No `--success`, `--warning`, or `--info` semantic color tokens | `theme.css` | Feedback patterns in `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/apps/web/src/routes/design-system/-components/compositions/FeedbackPatterns.tsx` use raw Tailwind colors (`border-l-green-500`, `bg-green-100`, etc.) instead of semantic tokens. This breaks theme customization for feedback colors. |
| POLISH | Chart colors in dark mode differ between `theme.css` and Zinc preset | `theme.css` lines 62-66 vs `presets.ts` lines 85-89 | The dark chart colors are identical, but the light mode ring value divergence suggests these files may drift further over time. |

**Recommendation:** Add `--success`, `--warning`, `--info` semantic tokens to `theme.css`. Fix the `destructive-foreground` value. Differentiate `secondary`, `muted`, and `accent` -- even subtle lightness/chroma differences would help.

### 1.2 Typography

**Strengths:**
- System font stack in `apps/web/src/styles.css` (line 15-18) covers all major platforms.
- Font smoothing enabled (`-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased`).
- Type scale shown in design system page covers xs through 4xl.
- Heading hierarchy (h1-h6) is well-defined with appropriate tracking and weight.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| IMPORTANT | No `font-display: swap` or web font loading strategy | `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/apps/web/src/styles.css` | The theme editor offers "Inter" as a font family option but Inter is never imported or loaded. If a user selects it, they get the fallback silently. No `@font-face` declarations exist. |
| IMPORTANT | Inconsistent font size between mobile and desktop on Input/Textarea | `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/packages/ui/src/components/Input.tsx` line 11 | Uses `text-base md:text-sm` which means 16px on mobile, 14px on desktop. While this prevents iOS zoom on focus, it creates a noticeable size jump at the `md` breakpoint. |
| POLISH | Demo form labels use `text-xl font-bold` which is oversized | `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/apps/web/src/components/demo.FormComponents.tsx` lines 53, 73 | Labels like "First name" render at 20px bold, which is more prominent than most section headings. Should use the standard Label styling. |
| POLISH | No `text-balance` or `text-pretty` on long headings | Landing page headings | The hero title at `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/apps/web/src/components/landing/HeroSection.tsx` line 20 could benefit from `text-balance` (CSS text balancing) for more even line breaks at responsive breakpoints. |

### 1.3 Spacing

**Strengths:**
- Consistent use of Tailwind spacing scale throughout.
- Card component uses `gap-6` and `py-6` for consistent internal rhythm.
- Sections use `py-24` consistently across all landing sections.
- `max-w-7xl` container width used consistently.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| IMPORTANT | Header padding (`py-3`) creates a thin 57px header | `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/apps/web/src/components/Header.tsx` line 49 | With `py-3` (12px top and bottom) plus content, the header is only ~57px tall. Modern dashboards (Vercel, Linear) use 48-64px headers but with more generous internal spacing. The header feels cramped on desktop. |
| POLISH | Footer is minimal at `py-3` | `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/apps/web/src/components/Footer.tsx` line 9 | Only 24px total vertical padding. The footer feels dismissive. Consider `py-6` or `py-8` for a more balanced presence. |
| POLISH | AuthLayout uses magic number `min-h-[calc(100vh-57px)]` | `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/apps/web/src/components/AuthLayout.tsx` line 22 | Hardcoded 57px header height assumption. If the header height changes, auth pages break. Use `min-h-[calc(100dvh-var(--header-height))]` or a flex layout approach. |

### 1.4 Component Library Evaluation

**Total components in `packages/ui`:** 21 (Accordion, Avatar, Badge, Button, Card, Checkbox, Dialog, DropdownMenu, HoverCard, Input, Label, NavigationMenu, OAuthButton, PasswordInput, Select, Separator, Skeleton, Slider, Sonner/Toaster, Switch, Textarea, Tooltip)

**Strengths:**
- All components follow shadcn/ui patterns exactly: CVA variants, `cn()` utility, `data-slot` attributes, Radix primitives.
- Named exports only (correct per project conventions).
- `asChild` pattern supported on Button and Badge.
- Button has excellent variant coverage: 6 style variants x 8 size variants (including icon sizes).
- Avatar component includes `AvatarBadge`, `AvatarGroup`, `AvatarGroupCount` -- more complete than stock shadcn.
- Dialog supports `showCloseButton` prop on both `DialogContent` and `DialogFooter`.
- OAuthButton with provider-specific branded icons and loading state.
- PasswordInput with strength indicator and rules checklist.

**Missing Components (needed by the app):**

| Severity | Component | Where needed | Current workaround |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| CRITICAL | Table | `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/apps/web/src/routes/org/members.tsx` line 216 | Raw `<table>` with manual Tailwind classes. No consistent table component exists in `@repo/ui`. |
| IMPORTANT | Tabs | `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/apps/web/src/routes/design-system/index.tsx` line 288 | Custom tab implementation with raw `<button>` elements. Should use Radix Tabs for accessibility (arrow key navigation, focus management). |
| IMPORTANT | Alert / AlertDescription | `FeedbackPatterns.tsx`, `__root.tsx` (ErrorFallback) | Feedback cards use Cards with custom border-left styling. A proper Alert component would standardize this. |
| IMPORTANT | Form / FormField / FormMessage | Auth pages, org settings | No form wrapper component. Each page manually implements `space-y-2` + `Label` + `Input` + error display. |
| POLISH | Sheet (mobile sidebar) | Theme editor, potential future use | Theme editor implements its own sidebar panel. A Sheet component would be reusable. |
| POLISH | Progress | Password strength could use this | PasswordInput implements its own segmented progress bar. |
| POLISH | RadioGroup | Form demos, future settings pages | Not available despite being a common form primitive. |
| POLISH | Toggle / ToggleGroup | Theme editor shadow selection | Uses buttons that look like toggles but aren't actual toggle components. |
| POLISH | Popover | Could complement HoverCard | Not available; only HoverCard exists. Popover is click-triggered vs hover. |

### 1.5 Icons

**Strengths:**
- Consistent use of `lucide-react` throughout.
- Icons consistently sized at `size-4` (16px) for inline and `size-5` (20px) for featured.
- Button component has smart SVG sizing: `[&_svg:not([class*='size-'])]:size-4`.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| POLISH | Mixed icon sizing syntax | Various files | Some files use `h-4 w-4` (HeroSection line 40, LocaleSwitcher line 24) while others use `size-4` (UserMenu line 60). Should standardize on `size-4`. |
| POLISH | Landing page icons use `h-8 w-8` for feature cards | `FeaturesSection.tsx` line 39 | Should use `size-8` for consistency. |

### 1.6 Animations & Transitions

**Strengths:**
- `tailwindcss-animate` plugin provides consistent enter/exit animations.
- Hero section has a custom fade-in-up animation (`animate-hero-in`) with staggered delay variant.
- `AnimatedSection` uses IntersectionObserver for scroll-triggered reveals -- correct approach.
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` in both CSS (`styles.css` lines 53-64) and JS (`AnimatedSection.tsx` line 17).
- Dialog, Select, DropdownMenu all have smooth open/close animations via Radix data attributes.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| POLISH | FeatureCard hover uses `hover:-translate-y-1` which can cause layout shift | `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/apps/web/src/components/FeatureCard.tsx` line 18 | Multiple cards moving on hover in a grid can feel jittery. Consider using `hover:shadow-md` only, or use `will-change-transform` for GPU acceleration. |
| POLISH | Theme editor sidebar transition is abrupt on mobile | `ThemeEditor.tsx` line 455 | Uses `translate-x-full` to `translate-x-0` with `duration-200`. The backdrop fade and panel slide should be coordinated. Consider adding `ease-out` on open and `ease-in` on close. |
| POLISH | No skeleton loading states in actual app pages | Auth pages, org pages | Components exist (`Skeleton`) but are never used in real loading states. Auth pages show disabled inputs during loading; org pages show nothing during data fetch. |

---

## 2. Visual Design Quality

### 2.1 Landing Page (`/`)

**Strengths:**
- Clean, modern hero section with background glow effects.
- Stat counter section provides social proof.
- Consistent section structure via `SectionHeading` component.
- Card-based feature grid is well-organized.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| CRITICAL | No visual branding -- the app name "Roxabi" is plain text | `Header.tsx` line 51, `AuthLayout.tsx` line 25 | No logo, no icon, no distinctive mark. The header shows "Roxabi" in `text-xl font-bold`. Compare to Vercel (triangle logo), Linear (stylized icon). This is the most visible design gap. |
| IMPORTANT | Hero background glow is barely visible in light mode | `HeroSection.tsx` lines 10-13 | Uses `bg-primary/5` and `bg-chart-1/5` with 120px blur. At 5% opacity, this is nearly invisible on white. Consider 8-10% opacity, or a subtle gradient mesh. |
| IMPORTANT | All landing sections look similar -- no visual variety | `index.tsx` | Every section uses the same Card + grid pattern. The DX section and Features section are visually identical. Consider varying layouts: one section as a two-column with illustration, another as a timeline, etc. |
| POLISH | Stats section uses `hidden sm:block` for dividers | `HeroSection.tsx` line 51 | On mobile, stats stack with no visual separation. Add `border-b` or `space-y-4` dividers for mobile. |
| POLISH | CTA section background gradient is subtle to the point of invisible | `CtaSection.tsx` line 9 | `from-primary/5 via-muted/50 to-chart-1/5` creates an almost imperceptible gradient. |

### 2.2 Auth Pages (`/login`, `/register`, `/reset-password`, etc.)

**Strengths:**
- Consistent layout via `AuthLayout` component.
- Good error handling with `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"`.
- OAuth buttons with branded provider icons.
- Password strength indicator on registration.
- Magic link flow with cooldown timer.
- "Or" divider between password and OAuth login.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| IMPORTANT | OAuth grid layout uses inline template literal for class | `login.tsx` line 152 | `` `grid gap-2 ${providers.google && providers.github ? 'grid-cols-2' : 'grid-cols-1'}` `` -- this bypasses `cn()` and won't be caught by Tailwind's class detection. |
| IMPORTANT | Error messages lack icon or color differentiation from success messages | `register.tsx` lines 70-76 | Error uses `text-destructive` but success message uses `text-muted-foreground`. Neither has an icon. Consider adding `AlertCircle` icon for errors and `CheckCircle` for success. |
| POLISH | "Or" divider implementation is custom in each auth page | `login.tsx` lines 142-149, `register.tsx` lines 119-126 | Duplicate code. Should be extracted to a reusable `Divider` or `OrDivider` component. |
| POLISH | Auth card width (`max-w-md`) may feel narrow on large screens | `AuthLayout.tsx` line 29 | 448px is fine for mobile but feels small centered on a 1440px monitor. Consider `max-w-sm` for cleaner proportions or adding side illustration for large screens. |

### 2.3 Organization Pages (`/org/settings`, `/org/members`)

**Strengths:**
- Clean card-based layout.
- Danger zone with red destructive styling.
- Dialog confirmation for delete action.
- Table with role badges using semantic badge variants.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| CRITICAL | Tables use raw HTML `<table>` with no responsive strategy | `members.tsx` lines 216-270 | On mobile, the table overflows horizontally (`overflow-x-auto`). This is the minimum viable approach but looks broken on narrow screens. Members should use a card/list layout on mobile. |
| IMPORTANT | No loading states on org pages | `members.tsx`, `settings.tsx` | When `activeOrg` is null, a plain text message shows. No skeleton loading pattern. |
| IMPORTANT | Role select dropdown inline in table row is cramped | `members.tsx` line 237 | `h-7 w-28` for inline select trigger. The hit target is only 28px tall which is below the 44px minimum for touch. |
| POLISH | No breadcrumb navigation on org subpages | `members.tsx`, `settings.tsx` | User navigates to `/org/members` but there's no way to go back to org overview or switch between members/settings without the user menu. |

### 2.4 Design System Page (`/design-system`)

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive showcase with interactive prop controls.
- Theme editor sidebar with color pickers, font settings, radius controls.
- Composition examples (auth forms, data display, feedback patterns).
- Tab navigation with keyboard support (arrow keys).
- Code snippet display with copy button.
- WCAG AA contrast badge in color picker.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| IMPORTANT | Custom tabs implementation instead of Radix Tabs | `design-system/index.tsx` lines 288-325 | The tab navigation re-implements roving tabindex with `onKeyDown` handlers. Radix Tabs would provide this for free with better screen reader support. |
| IMPORTANT | ComponentShowcase `<select>` element is unstyled | `ComponentShowcase.tsx` lines 117-131 | Uses a native `<select>` with manual Tailwind classes instead of the `@repo/ui` Select component. Looks visually inconsistent. |
| POLISH | "Show code" toggle is a plain text button | `ComponentShowcase.tsx` lines 169-178 | No visual affordance that it's clickable. Should use `Button variant="ghost"` or add an expand/collapse icon. |
| POLISH | CodeSnippet has no syntax highlighting | `CodeSnippet.tsx` line 46 | Just `<pre><code>` with monospace font. No color differentiation for JSX tags, props, strings. |

---

## 3. Responsive Design Audit

### 3.1 Breakpoints

The app uses Tailwind's default breakpoints: `sm` (640px), `md` (768px), `lg` (1024px), `xl` (1280px).

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| IMPORTANT | Mobile menu has no animation | `Header.tsx` lines 120-176 | The mobile panel appears/disappears instantly. Should slide down or fade in. |
| IMPORTANT | Mobile menu close on outside click uses `document.addEventListener('click')` | `Header.tsx` lines 33-36 | This can conflict with other click handlers. Consider using Radix's `DismissableLayer` pattern or a React portal with backdrop. |
| POLISH | ThemeToggle placeholder during SSR shows disabled Sun icon | `ThemeToggle.tsx` lines 16-19 | During hydration, a disabled button renders. This causes a brief flash of disabled state. Consider rendering nothing or a skeleton. |

### 3.2 Touch Targets

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| CRITICAL | Checkbox is `size-4` (16px) -- far below 44px minimum | `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/packages/ui/src/components/Checkbox.tsx` line 14 | WCAG 2.5.8 requires 44x44px target size. The checkbox is 16x16px. While the label extends the target area when properly associated, standalone checkboxes fail this criterion. |
| IMPORTANT | Switch `sm` size is `h-3.5` (14px) tall | `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/packages/ui/src/components/Switch.tsx` line 20 | The small switch variant is only 14px tall. The thumb is 12px. Very difficult to tap on mobile. |
| IMPORTANT | Select trigger in org members table is `h-7` (28px) | `members.tsx` line 237 | Below 44px minimum touch target. |
| POLISH | UserMenu avatar trigger is `size-8` (32px) | `UserMenu.tsx` line 60 | Slightly below 44px target but adequate due to the circular shape making it easy to hit. |

### 3.3 Layout Adaptation

**Strengths:**
- Landing page grids adapt: `lg:grid-cols-4` to `sm:grid-cols-2` to single column.
- Header hides desktop nav and shows hamburger at `md` breakpoint.
- Auth pages are full-width on mobile, centered card on desktop.
- Dialog content uses `max-w-[calc(100%-2rem)]` on mobile, `sm:max-w-lg` on desktop.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| IMPORTANT | Design system page sidebar pushes content off-screen on tablet | `design-system/index.tsx` line 276 | `lg:mr-80` only activates at 1024px, but the sidebar is 320px (`w-80`). At 1024px, content gets `1024 - 320 = 704px` which is tight. On smaller tablets, the sidebar covers content entirely. |
| POLISH | Mobile panel in Header doesn't trap focus | `Header.tsx` lines 120-176 | When mobile menu is open, tab key can still reach elements behind it. |

---

## 4. Component State Coverage

### 4.1 Button States

| State | Covered | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Default | Yes | All 6 variants well-defined |
| Hover | Yes | Opacity changes, bg changes per variant |
| Active/Pressed | Partial | No explicit `:active` styles. Relies on browser defaults. |
| Focus | Yes | `focus-visible:ring-[3px]` with ring color |
| Disabled | Yes | `disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50` |
| Loading | No | No built-in loading spinner. OAuthButton has it, but Button does not. |
| aria-invalid | Yes | Ring changes to destructive |

**Recommendation:** Add a `loading` prop to Button that shows a spinner and disables interaction. Currently every consumer re-implements this (login page, register page, org settings).

### 4.2 Input States

| State | Covered | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Default | Yes | Border, shadow |
| Placeholder | Yes | `placeholder:text-muted-foreground` |
| Focus | Yes | `focus-visible:border-ring focus-visible:ring-ring/50 focus-visible:ring-[3px]` |
| Disabled | Yes | Opacity reduction, no pointer events |
| Invalid/Error | Yes | `aria-invalid:ring-destructive/20 aria-invalid:border-destructive` |
| File input | Yes | Custom file input styling |
| Read-only | No | No distinct read-only styling |

### 4.3 Card States

| State | Covered | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Default | Yes | Border, shadow-sm, rounded-xl |
| Hover | No | Stock Card has no hover state. FeatureCard adds it. |
| Selected | No | No selected/active card state |
| Loading | No | Would need Skeleton integration |

---

## 5. Design Patterns Evaluation

### 5.1 Form Design

**Strengths:**
- Consistent `space-y-2` for label+input groups and `space-y-4` between fields.
- Labels use the `Label` component from `@repo/ui`.
- Inputs have proper `id` and `htmlFor` association.
- Error messages use `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"`.
- `aria-busy` on forms during submission.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| IMPORTANT | No unified form error pattern | All auth pages | Each page implements error display differently. Login uses a centered paragraph, register uses the same, but the error text has no icon and no background. Compare to Stripe where form errors have a red background, icon, and animation. |
| IMPORTANT | No field-level validation feedback during typing | Auth pages | Validation only happens on submit. No inline validation as the user types (except PasswordInput strength). Real-time email format validation would improve UX. |
| POLISH | No asterisk or "required" indicator on required fields | Auth pages | All inputs have `required` attribute but no visual indicator. Users cannot tell which fields are required without trying to submit. |

### 5.2 Table Design

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| CRITICAL | No Table component in `@repo/ui` | N/A | Tables in `members.tsx` use raw HTML with manual styling. This means no consistent hover rows, no sorting indicators, no pagination styling. A Table component should be added to `@repo/ui`. |

### 5.3 Modal/Dialog Patterns

**Strengths:**
- Good overlay (black/50 backdrop).
- Consistent header/footer layout.
- Close button with X icon and sr-only text.
- Smooth animation in/out.
- `DialogFooter` supports both `showCloseButton` and manual close buttons.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| POLISH | Dialog close button uses `ring-offset-background` which is an old shadcn pattern | `Dialog.tsx` line 65 | This class name references a variable that does not exist in the current Tailwind v4/OKLch setup. It's a no-op. |
| POLISH | No confirmation dialog utility | Org delete, member removal | Each destructive action rebuilds the same pattern: Dialog with title + description + cancel/confirm buttons. A `ConfirmDialog` utility component would reduce code. |

### 5.4 Toast/Notification Design

**Strengths:**
- Sonner integration with `richColors` prop.
- Themed to match the design system colors.
- Used consistently across all pages.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| POLISH | Toaster position not explicitly set | `__root.tsx` line 109 | Sonner defaults to bottom-right. This should be explicitly configured for consistency. |
| POLISH | No custom toast styling for different types | `Sonner.tsx` | The Toaster applies generic theme classes. `richColors` helps but custom styled toasts (with icons matching the app's design language) would look more polished. |

### 5.5 Navigation Patterns

**Strengths:**
- Sticky header with `backdrop-blur` -- modern and functional.
- Active link highlighting via `activeProps={{ className: 'bg-accent' }}`.
- Mobile menu with escape key and outside click dismissal.
- User menu with avatar dropdown.
- Org switcher with inline create.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| IMPORTANT | No page transition animations | Router config | Page changes are instant with no transition. Consider a subtle top-loading bar (like NProgress) or a fade transition. |
| IMPORTANT | Active nav state is hard to see | `Header.tsx` lines 58, 64, 70 | `bg-accent` is nearly identical to `bg-background` in the default Zinc theme (both are very light gray). Active state needs more visual weight. |
| POLISH | Mobile and desktop nav items are duplicated | `Header.tsx` | The same links appear in both desktop and mobile sections. While this is necessary for show/hide, extracting a nav link list would reduce maintenance burden. |

### 5.6 Button Hierarchy

**Strengths:**
- Clear hierarchy: default (primary), secondary, outline, ghost, link, destructive.
- Size variants include icon-specific sizes.
- Auth pages use primary CTA buttons correctly.

**Issues:**

| Severity | Issue | File | Details |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| POLISH | No "warning" button variant | Design system | Destructive covers red/danger, but there's no orange/yellow warning variant for cautious actions. |

---

## 6. Comparison to Best-in-Class

### vs. shadcn/ui Reference Implementation

| Aspect | Roxabi | shadcn/ui | Gap |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----|
| Component count | 21 | 45+ | Missing Table, Tabs, Sheet, Popover, Progress, RadioGroup, Toggle, Command, Calendar, Breadcrumb, Collapsible, Menubar, Pagination, ScrollArea, AlertDialog |
| Theme system | OKLch engine + 21 presets | CSS variables only | Roxabi is ahead with the derivation engine |
| Dark mode | Yes | Yes | Parity |
| Animations | Yes (tailwindcss-animate) | Yes | Parity |
| Accessibility | Good (Radix base) | Good (Radix base) | Parity |
| Docs/playground | Design system page | Storybook-like docs | Roxabi's interactive playground is comparable |

### vs. Vercel Dashboard

| Aspect | Roxabi | Vercel | Gap |
|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| Visual density | Low | High | Vercel packs more information per screen. Roxabi's spacing is generous but wastes space. |
| Loading states | Minimal | Excellent (skeleton screens everywhere) | Major gap -- Roxabi pages show nothing during load. |
| Micro-interactions | Basic hover states | Rich (counters, progress rings, animated charts) | Large gap in polish. |
| Navigation | Single-level | Sidebar + breadcrumbs + tabs | Roxabi will need more complex navigation as features grow. |
| Data tables | Raw HTML | Custom component with sort/filter/pagination | Critical gap. |

### vs. Linear

| Aspect | Roxabi | Linear | Gap |
|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| Typography | System fonts | Custom Inter/SF Pro | Linear's typography feels more intentional. |
| Animations | Scroll reveal + dialog | Fluid page transitions, spring physics | Large gap in animation sophistication. |
| Keyboard shortcuts | None | Extensive | Not applicable for a boilerplate, but worth noting. |
| Color use | Muted/neutral | Bold accent colors with purpose | Roxabi's default theme is very neutral/gray. |

### vs. Stripe Components

| Aspect | Roxabi | Stripe | Gap |
|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| Form validation | Submit-time only | Inline with debounce | Stripe provides real-time feedback. |
| Error handling | Text strings | Structured error cards with codes | Roxabi's errors are minimalist. |
| Component polish | Standard | Very high (custom focus rings, animated borders) | Stripe's components feel hand-crafted. |

---

## 7. Prioritized Design Improvements

### CRITICAL (looks broken or unprofessional)

1. **Add a logo/brand mark** -- The app name in plain text is the single biggest design weakness. File: `Header.tsx` line 51, `AuthLayout.tsx` line 25.

2. **Add a Table component to `@repo/ui`** -- Raw HTML tables in org pages look unfinished and break on mobile. Files: `members.tsx` lines 216-270.

3. **Fix `destructive-foreground` in light mode** -- It equals `destructive`, making text-on-destructive-bg invisible. File: `theme.css` line 22.

4. **Ensure touch targets meet 44px minimum** -- Checkbox (16px), Switch sm (14px), inline table select (28px) all fail. Files: `Checkbox.tsx`, `Switch.tsx`, `members.tsx`.

### IMPORTANT (significantly improves visual quality)

5. **Add loading/skeleton states to all pages** -- Auth pages, org pages, and data-fetching views should show skeletons during load. Ship a `PageSkeleton` composition.

6. **Add `--success`, `--warning`, `--info` semantic tokens** -- Feedback patterns currently use hardcoded Tailwind colors that break with theme customization. File: `theme.css`.

7. **Differentiate `secondary`, `muted`, and `accent` colors** -- All three are identical in the default theme. File: `theme.css` lines 16-19.

8. **Add a loading spinner prop to Button** -- Every page re-implements button loading state. Add `loading?: boolean` to Button component. File: `Button.tsx`.

9. **Use Radix Tabs on design system page** -- The custom tab implementation has accessibility gaps. File: `design-system/index.tsx` lines 288-325.

10. **Add page transition or loading indicator** -- Instant page swaps feel unpolished. Add a top progress bar (NProgress pattern).

11. **Improve mobile table layout** -- Members table should switch to a card/list layout below `md` breakpoint. File: `members.tsx`.

12. **Make active nav state more visible** -- `bg-accent` is too subtle in the default theme. Add underline or bolder background. File: `Header.tsx`.

13. **Add mobile menu animation** -- Panel appears/disappears instantly. Add slide-down transition. File: `Header.tsx`.

14. **Fix OAuth button grid template literal** -- Replace inline template with `cn()` call. Files: `login.tsx` line 152, `register.tsx` line 129.

15. **Add Inter font import** -- Theme editor offers Inter but it's never loaded. Add `@font-face` or Google Fonts import. File: `styles.css`.

### POLISH (delightful details)

16. **Standardize icon sizing** -- Replace all `h-4 w-4` with `size-4`. Across multiple files.

17. **Add `text-balance` to headings** -- Prevents awkward line breaks. Hero title, section headings.

18. **Extract OrDivider component** -- Duplicate "Or" divider in login and register pages.

19. **Add syntax highlighting to CodeSnippet** -- Use Shiki or Prism for colored code in design system. File: `CodeSnippet.tsx`.

20. **Use `@repo/ui` Select in ComponentShowcase** -- Replace native `<select>` with the UI library version. File: `ComponentShowcase.tsx` line 117.

21. **Increase Footer presence** -- From `py-3` to `py-6` or `py-8`. File: `Footer.tsx` line 9.

22. **Fix demo form label sizing** -- Replace `text-xl font-bold` with standard Label sizing. File: `demo.FormComponents.tsx` lines 53, 73.

23. **Add confirm dialog utility** -- Extract the pattern from org delete and member removal into a reusable `ConfirmDialog`. Files: `settings.tsx`, `members.tsx`.

24. **Remove dead `ring-offset-background` class** -- Referencing a non-existent CSS variable. File: `Dialog.tsx` line 65.

25. **Add `will-change-transform` to hover-lifted cards** -- Prevents paint jank on feature card hover. File: `FeatureCard.tsx`.

26. **Make hero glow more visible in light mode** -- Increase opacity from 5% to 8-10%. File: `HeroSection.tsx` lines 10-13.

27. **Add form field required indicator** -- Asterisk or "(required)" text on mandatory fields. Auth pages.

28. **Add breadcrumbs to org subpages** -- Help users orient within `/org/settings` and `/org/members`.

29. **Explicitly set Toaster position** -- Sonner defaults are fine but explicit is better. File: `__root.tsx` line 109.

30. **Coordinate theme editor sidebar animation** -- Sync backdrop fade with panel slide for smoother feel. File: `ThemeEditor.tsx`.
