title: "Documentation & Onboarding Improvements"
description: Analysis of README enhancements, .env.example enrichment, and ubiquitous language glossary for improved developer onboarding.
---

## Context

The [repo comparison analysis](./repo-comparisons/163-consolidated-summary) (epic #163) identified documentation gaps across 16 public repositories. Theme 9 ("Comprehensive README as Onboarding Surface") and the Top 20 takeaways highlighted that roxabi's README is text-heavy, lacks visual demonstration, and the `.env.example` could better guide new developers. This analysis scopes the improvements for [issue #226](https://github.com/MickaelV0/roxabi_boilerplate/issues/226).

**GitHub issue:** #226
**Parent epic:** #163

## Questions Explored

1. What specific improvements to `.env.example` would meaningfully reduce onboarding friction?
2. What should a demo GIF showcase to communicate the product's value in under 10 seconds?
3. What domain terms belong in a ubiquitous language glossary, how should it be structured, and should it include state machine diagrams?

## Scope Assessment

- **Tier:** F-lite (clear scope, documented requirements, single domain — docs only)
- **Affected packages:** `apps/web` (Fumadocs Mermaid plugin), root (`.env.example`, `README.md`)
- **Deliverables:** 4 tasks (1 dropped from original issue, 1 prerequisite added)
- **Risk:** Low — no code changes, no architectural impact, no deployment changes
- **Note:** `.env.example` is a configuration artifact that ships with the repo and directly affects developer setup. Changes should be reviewed by someone who has run the app end-to-end to verify required/optional semantics.

## Analysis

### Task 0: Add Mermaid Support to Fumadocs (Size: XS)

**Current state:** The Fumadocs setup (`apps/web/source.config.ts`) has no remark/rehype plugins configured. Mermaid code blocks (e.g., in `artifacts/analyses/00-infrastructure-setup-summary.mdx`) render as plain code blocks, not diagrams.

**Proposed approach:**

1. Install a Mermaid rendering plugin compatible with Fumadocs MDX (e.g., `rehype-mermaid` or `remark-mermaid`)
2. Add it to `source.config.ts` via the `remarkPlugins` or `rehypePlugins` config
3. Verify existing Mermaid blocks in `00-infrastructure-setup-summary.mdx` render correctly

**Impact:** Unblocks state machine diagrams in the ubiquitous language doc and benefits all future documentation using Mermaid.

### Task 1: Enrich `.env.example` (Size: XS)

**Current state:** The `.env.example` has 49 lines with basic grouping (Application, Database, Authentication, Rate Limiting, etc.) and some inline comments. However, it has several onboarding gaps:

- **No explanation of required vs optional** — New developers cannot tell which vars must be set to start locally vs which are only needed for specific features (e.g., OAuth providers, Resend).
- **No worked configuration examples** — The production overrides section at the bottom is a start, but there's no "copy this and go" block for the most common setup (local development with default PostgreSQL).
- **Grouping is implicit** — Vars are loosely grouped but lack clear section headers or a consistent pattern.

**Proposed improvements:**

1. **Add required/optional markers** — Prefix each var group with `# Required` or `# Optional` headers. Uncommented vars are required for local dev; commented vars are optional.
2. **Standardize section headers** — Use `# ═══ Section Name ═══` format for clear visual separation.
3. **Add worked configuration blocks** at the end:
   - **Local dev** (default — just copy and run)
   - **Vercel preview** (auto-injected vars noted, manual overrides listed)
   - **VPS/self-hosted** (full production configuration example)
4. **Add inline context** for non-obvious vars — e.g., explain what `BETTER_AUTH_URL` should point to (the API, not the web app), why `CORS_ORIGIN` must match `APP_URL`.

**Impact:** Reduces "first `bun dev`" time from ~15 minutes of reading docs to ~2 minutes of copying `.env.example`.

### Task 2: Add Demo GIF to README (Size: S)

**Current state:** The README opens with "SaaS boilerplate with AI team integration" — a one-line description followed immediately by a tech stack table and `bun install` instructions. There is no visual element showing the product running. A developer evaluating roxabi must clone, install, and run the project before seeing what it does.

**Proposed approach:**

1. **Record a GIF walkthrough** (~10-15s) showing: landing page → login/signup → dashboard → one key feature (e.g., organization switching or role management)
2. **Place it at the top of the README** — immediately after the title and one-line description, before the Stack table
3. **Host the GIF in the repo** at `docs/assets/demo.gif` (or use a GitHub-hosted URL via an issue attachment for smaller repo size)
4. **Add alt text** for accessibility: `"Roxabi Boilerplate demo — signup, dashboard, and multi-tenant organization switching"`

**Recording approach:**
- Use the running app (local dev) with the `/agent-browser` skill or a screen recording tool
- Keep file size reasonable (aim for under 5MB to avoid slow clones — alternatively use GitHub's video embedding with MP4 for better compression)

**Dependency:** Recording requires the app running with representative data (seeded users, organizations, roles). If the current seed script does not produce visually representative data, a manual setup step or seed enhancement may be needed as a prerequisite.

**Maintenance:** GIFs become stale as the UI evolves. A note should be added to `docs/contributing.mdx` that the demo GIF should be re-recorded after major UI changes.

### Task 3: Create Ubiquitous Language Document (Size: S)

**Current state:** Domain terms are defined across multiple architecture docs (`multi-tenant.mdx`, `rbac.mdx`, `auth-security.mdx`) but there is no single reference glossary. This causes inconsistencies:

- "Tenant" vs "Organization" — used interchangeably in some docs, but technically Organization is the Better Auth entity and Tenant is the logical isolation boundary.
- "Member" — could mean a `members` table row (org membership) or a user with the "member" role.
- "Role" — could mean the Better Auth `role` text column or the RBAC `role_id` FK.

A ubiquitous language document (from Domain-Driven Design) provides a single source of truth for domain terminology used in code, docs, and conversation.

**Proposed structure** for `docs/architecture/ubiquitous-language.mdx`:

**Term glossary** (alphabetical, each term links to its canonical architecture doc):

| Term | Definition | Source |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Invitation** | A pending org membership invite with an expiration. Requires acceptance by the invitee. | `auth-security.mdx` |
| **Member** | A user's membership in a specific organization. Stored in the `members` table with both a Better Auth `role` text column and an RBAC `role_id` FK. | `rbac.mdx` |
| **Organization** | A Better Auth entity representing a group of users. Maps to a row in the `organizations` table. | `multi-tenant.mdx` |
| **Permission** | A `resource:action` string (e.g., `members:write`). 15 possible permissions across 5 resources and 3 actions. | `rbac.mdx` |
| **Role** | A named set of permissions scoped to an organization. Four defaults: Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer. | `rbac.mdx` |
| **Session** | An authenticated session tracking the user and their active organization via `sessions.active_organization_id`. | `multi-tenant.mdx` |
| **Tenant** | The logical data isolation boundary. Currently 1:1 with Organization (each org is a root tenant). | `multi-tenant.mdx` |
| **Tenant Context** | The resolved `tenant_id` propagated from the HTTP session through CLS into PostgreSQL RLS policies. | `multi-tenant.mdx` |
| **User** | An authenticated individual with a `users` table row. Can belong to multiple organizations. | `auth-security.mdx` |

**Additional sections:**
- **Common Confusions** — Clarifying the ambiguities listed above (Tenant vs Organization, Member the entity vs Member the role, Better Auth role vs RBAC role)
- **State machine diagrams** — The original issue requests these. The most useful diagrams would cover: Invitation lifecycle (pending → accepted / expired / revoked), Session lifecycle (created → active → org-switched → expired), and Member lifecycle (invited → active → removed). Authored as Mermaid `stateDiagram-v2` blocks in MDX. **Prerequisite:** Mermaid rendering must be enabled in Fumadocs first (see Task 0).

**Format decisions:**
- Alphabetical ordering for quick lookup
- Each term links to its canonical architecture doc (implementer should verify definitions match the cited source)
- Scope to current model only — extend as new features ship

### Dropped: Comparison Table

The original issue included a "When to use roxabi vs X" comparison section for the README. This has been **dropped from scope** per lead decision during the interview phase. Rationale: roxabi is not yet publicly marketed — a comparison table requires selecting specific competitors, choosing fair comparison axes, and ongoing maintenance as features change. This is better suited to a marketing/positioning effort when the project reaches that maturity.

**Issue reconciliation:** Issue #226's acceptance criteria include "README includes comparison/positioning section." This AC should be removed from the issue or moved to a separate follow-up issue before implementation begins.

## Conclusions

1. **`.env.example` enrichment is the highest-priority task.** It directly reduces onboarding friction for every new developer. Self-contained, XS effort. The `.env.example` is a configuration artifact (not purely documentation) — changes should be reviewed by a developer familiar with the actual required/optional var semantics.

2. **Demo GIF is the most visible improvement but has an implicit dependency.** Recording requires the app running with representative seed data. This dependency should be resolved before the GIF task is started. Worth doing for the immediate impact on first impressions.

3. **Ubiquitous language doc codifies existing decisions into a single reference.** It belongs in `docs/architecture/` (not `docs/` root) because it is architecture-scoped. State machine diagrams for Invitation, Session, and Member lifecycles add value and can be authored as Mermaid blocks. This is a long-term investment in consistency for both humans and AI agents.

4. **Comparison table is intentionally descoped.** The issue's acceptance criteria should be updated to reflect this before implementation.

## Open Questions

- **GIF hosting:** Store in repo at `docs/assets/demo.gif` (simple, versioned) or host externally via GitHub issue attachment (smaller repo size)? Recommend deciding during spec.
- **Seed data adequacy:** Does the current seed script produce enough representative data (multiple orgs, roles, members) for a compelling GIF walkthrough? If not, a seed enhancement is a prerequisite.
- **Source verification:** Each term in the ubiquitous language glossary cites a source architecture doc. The implementer should verify that each cited doc's definition matches the glossary entry before publishing.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Update issue #226 to remove the comparison table acceptance criterion (or create a separate follow-up issue)
- [ ] Create spec from this analysis: `artifacts/specs/226-documentation-onboarding.mdx`
- [ ] Implementation order: Mermaid support (XS) → `.env.example` (XS) → ubiquitous language (S) → demo GIF (S)
- [ ] Verify seed script produces representative data before starting the GIF task
- [ ] Add a note to `docs/contributing.mdx` about re-recording the demo GIF after major UI changes
