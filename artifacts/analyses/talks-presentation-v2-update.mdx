title: "Analysis: Talks Presentation Update — Process-First Playbook Refresh"
description: Analysis for updating the /talks/claude-code presentation to reflect the evolved development process, new skills, and refreshed narrative.
---

## Context

The existing `/talks/claude-code` presentation was built in February 2026 as a conference-style companion page for a ~30-minute talk introducing Claude Code to developers, tech leads, and CTOs. Since then, the development process has evolved significantly:

- **Stats are stale**: The talk shows 1,782 sessions / 288 commits. Real numbers are now **1,930 sessions**, **301,550 messages**, **519 commits** over **25 days**.
- **Skills count is wrong**: The talk claims 15 skills, but there are now **16 skills**. The skills array includes `commit` (doesn't exist) and `context7` (a plugin, not a custom skill). Missing: `retro`, `validate`, `compress`.
- **Bootstrap pipeline evolved**: The pipeline now includes `/interview` → `/bootstrap` (analysis + spec with gates) → `/scaffold` → `/pr` → `/review` → `/promote`. The talk's End-to-End section doesn't reflect this.
- **New workflows not represented**: `/retro` (session analysis), `/validate` (quality gates), `/compress` (skill optimization), `/interview` (structured analysis) are all new.
- **Overall framing needs refresh**: The "introducing Claude Code" angle is stale. The new angle is a **process-first practical playbook** — lead with the process, show how to replicate it.

**Trigger**: Process evolved significantly + upcoming presentation + new features to showcase.

## Questions Explored

1. What narrative angle should replace "introducing Claude Code"?
2. Which sections need rework, and what should the new section order be?
3. How should the 16 skills be organized and presented?
4. What stats should be shown, and where do they come from?
5. Should the Tips section be kept, replaced, or merged?
6. What should the closing convey?

## Analysis

### Current State (8 sections)

| # | Section | Status | Issues |
|---|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Intro | Stale stats | 1,782 sessions → 1,930; 288 commits → 519 |
| 2 | Building Blocks | Wrong skill count + list | 15 → 16; `commit` doesn't exist; missing `retro`, `validate`, `compress` |
| 3 | Specialization | Mostly accurate | Minor refresh needed (examples) |
| 4 | Dev Process | Accurate | Tiers, hooks, worktrees all correct |
| 5 | Agent Teams | Accurate | Orchestrator model, review pipeline, honest take all current |
| 6 | End-to-End | Outdated pipeline | Missing `/interview`, doesn't reflect evolved `/bootstrap` with analysis+spec gates |
| 7 | Tips | Filler | Useful but disconnected — no coherent narrative thread |
| 8 | Closing | Generic | Before/after is fine but closing should give audience actionable next steps |

### New Narrative: Process-First Playbook

The presentation shifts from "here's this tool" to "here's exactly how we ship features — and here are the tools that make it work." This is a **replicable playbook** for the audience.

**Core thesis:** "Specialization + process discipline + human gates = production-quality AI-assisted development."

### Updated Stats (from `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` and git)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Sessions | 1,930 | stats-cache.json `totalSessions` |
| Messages | 301,550 | stats-cache.json `totalMessages` |
| Commits | 519 | `git log --oneline staging` |
| Period | 25 days | Jan 23 – Feb 16, 2026 |
| Skills | 16 | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` count |
| Agents | 9 | `.claude/agents/*.md` count |
| Peak day | Feb 13 | 25,140 messages, 108 sessions |

### Skill Ecosystem (16 skills grouped by phase)

| Phase | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Plan** | `/interview`, `/bootstrap`, `/issue-triage`, `/adr` | Requirements gathering, specs, triage, architectural decisions |
| **Build** | `/scaffold`, `/test` | Code generation from specs, test generation |
| **Review** | `/review`, `/1b1` | Multi-agent review, finding walkthrough |
| **Ship** | `/pr`, `/promote`, `/cleanup` | Pull requests, releases, branch cleanup |
| **Maintain** | `/validate`, `/retro`, `/issues`, `/agent-browser`, `/compress` | Quality checks, retrospectives, issue dashboard, browser testing, skill optimization |

## Shapes

### Shape A: Content-Only Update

- **Description:** Update stats, fix skill count/list, refresh text content in i18n messages and components. Keep the same 8 sections, same order, same components.
- **Trade-offs:**
  - ✅ Minimal code changes — mostly i18n string updates
  - ✅ No new components or layout changes
  - ❌ Misses the narrative refresh — still "introducing Claude Code"
  - ❌ No Toolchain section, no Lessons Learned, Tips stays as filler
- **Rough scope:** ~20 i18n keys updated, 2-3 component edits. S-M size.

### Shape B: Section Refresh (Recommended)

- **Description:** Rework the section structure to 9 sections with new order. Replace Tips with Lessons Learned, add new Toolchain section, update all stats, fix skill list, refresh End-to-End pipeline, update Closing to call-to-action. Reuse existing component architecture (`SectionContainer`, `PresentationNav`, etc.).
- **Trade-offs:**
  - ✅ Full narrative refresh — process-first playbook angle
  - ✅ 16 skills properly organized by workflow phase
  - ✅ Lessons Learned replaces filler Tips section
  - ✅ Call-to-action closing gives audience actionable next steps
  - ✅ Reuses existing component patterns — no architectural changes
  - ❌ More i18n keys to add/update (~50+)
  - ❌ 2 new section components (ToolchainSection, LessonsLearnedSection)
  - ❌ PresentationNav needs update for 9 sections
- **Rough scope:** 2 new components, ~60 i18n keys, ~8 component edits. M size.

### Shape C: Full Redesign

- **Description:** Redesign the entire presentation from scratch with new visual language, potentially new interaction patterns (e.g., tabbed sections instead of scroll-snap, interactive code playgrounds).
- **Trade-offs:**
  - ✅ Could be visually stunning
  - ❌ Massive scope — essentially rebuilding the feature
  - ❌ No architectural benefit over Shape B
  - ❌ Risks introducing bugs in a working feature
- **Rough scope:** Full rebuild. L-XL size.

## Fit Check

| Requirement | Shape A | Shape B | Shape C |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Updated stats | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Fixed skill count/list | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| New Toolchain section | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Narrative refresh | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Lessons Learned (expanded honest take) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Call-to-action closing | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Reuses existing architecture | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manageable scope | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

**Selected shape:** Shape B (Section Refresh) — Full narrative refresh with new Toolchain and Lessons Learned sections while reusing existing component architecture.

---

## Conclusions

1. **The talk needs a narrative shift** from "introducing Claude Code" to "process-first practical playbook." Lead with the process, show the tools that enable it.
2. **9 sections** in new order: Intro → Building Blocks → Specialization → Dev Process → **Toolchain** → Agent Teams → End-to-End → **Lessons Learned** → Closing.
3. **Stats must be updated** to real numbers from `stats-cache.json` and git: 1,930 sessions, 301K messages, 519 commits.
4. **Skills need correction**: 16 skills (not 15), grouped by workflow phase (plan, build, review, ship, maintain). Remove `commit` from array, add `retro`, `validate`, `compress`, `interview`.
5. **Tips section replaced** by expanded Lessons Learned drawing from the "honest take" and insights from 1,930 sessions.
6. **Closing becomes a call to action** — concrete next steps for the audience to replicate the process.
7. **No new dependencies, no architectural changes** — reuse existing SectionContainer, PresentationNav, CodeBlock, AnimatedSection patterns.

## Next Steps

- Promote this analysis to a spec with detailed section content, i18n key manifest, and component changes.
- Create a GitHub issue for tracking.
- Scaffold implementation via `/scaffold`.
