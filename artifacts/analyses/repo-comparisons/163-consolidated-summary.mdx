**Pattern summary:** Roxabi consistently wins on CI/CD (11 of 16 repos rated 🔴) and holds its own on tech stack. The consistent 🟢 columns are **How It Works**, **Unique Ideas**, and **Documentation** -- the analyzed repos bring significant novel ideas and methodology that roxabi has not yet adopted.

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Theme 1: Architecture Enforcement via Automated Tests

- **Pattern:** Use automated test suites (not just documentation) to enforce architectural rules -- no circular dependencies, correct layer direction, module boundary violations.
- **Seen in:** valora.ai (arch-unit-ts), review-flow (Clean Architecture with formal layer contracts), OpenClaw (protocol-check CI step)
- **Relevance to roxabi:** Roxabi's architectural decisions are enforced by documentation and code review alone. There is no automated mechanism to prevent architectural drift. As the codebase grows, manual enforcement will fail.
- **Recommended action:** Adopt `arch-unit-ts` and create a `tests/architecture/` suite in `apps/api` enforcing layer direction (controllers never import directly from infrastructure), no circular dependencies, and module boundary rules.

### Theme 2: AI-Agent-Aware Documentation

- **Pattern:** Repos increasingly maintain documentation files explicitly designed for AI coding agents -- separate from human contributor docs. This includes LLM-optimized navigation indexes, AGENTS.md files, structured memory banks, and token-budget-aware CLAUDE.md files.
- **Seen in:** review-flow (llm-index.md), aidd (vision.md + AGENTS.md + activity-log.md), ai-driven-dev/rules (memory-bank pattern), TrigMem (Pointer Pattern + token budget), OpenClaw (AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md symlink), nanobot (workspace/ directory), nanoclaw (token count badge), LocalAI (AGENTS.md with implementation guidance)
- **Relevance to roxabi:** Roxabi's CLAUDE.md is comprehensive but growing. It lacks a token budget, an LLM-optimized index, and a formal separation between human-facing and agent-facing documentation.
- **Recommended action:** (1) Add a token budget target to CLAUDE.md (keep it under 500 tokens of project identity, with pointers to docs/). (2) Create an LLM-optimized doc index. (3) Add a repo token-count badge to README. (4) Formalize the Pointer Pattern in contributing.mdx.

### Theme 3: Release Automation

- **Pattern:** Multiple repos use `release-please`, `release-it`, or goreleaser to fully automate changelog generation, version bumping, and GitHub Release creation from Conventional Commits.
- **Seen in:** review-flow (release-please), aidd (release-it), ai-driven-dev/prompts (custom CI release), memU (release-please + OIDC PyPI), LocalAI (goreleaser), OpenClaw (3 release channels)
- **Relevance to roxabi:** Roxabi's `/promote` workflow is manual. Changelog entries are hand-written. As the release cadence increases, this becomes a bottleneck and a source of inconsistency.
- **Recommended action:** Evaluate `release-please` for the roxabi monorepo. It integrates natively with Conventional Commits (which roxabi already enforces via commitlint) and auto-generates CHANGELOG entries and GitHub Releases.

### Theme 4: Security Scanning and Secret Detection

- **Pattern:** Production repos integrate secret scanning, SSRF protection, security test suites, and structured security documentation into their CI pipelines.
- **Seen in:** OpenClaw (detect-secrets baseline), LocalAI (Gosec + SARIF), valora.ai (MCP security registry), safeclaw (SSRF protection + shell sandboxing), nanoclaw (SECURITY.md threat model), ClawRouter (openclaw.security.json plugin disclosure)
- **Relevance to roxabi:** Roxabi has **no security scanning** in CI, no SSRF protection for outbound HTTP, no secret detection baseline, and no SECURITY.md or threat model documentation.
- **Recommended action:** (1) Add `detect-secrets` with a `.secrets.baseline` to CI. (2) Create `docs/guides/security.mdx` with threat model covering JWT auth, RLS, API security, and secrets management. (3) Add SSRF protection utility for any outbound HTTP calls.

### Theme 5: Test Tier Separation and Coverage Enforcement

- **Pattern:** Mature repos separate tests into explicit tiers (unit / integration / e2e / live / architecture / security / performance) with different vitest configs and distinct CI stages. Coverage thresholds (65-80%) are enforced in CI.
- **Seen in:** OpenClaw (unit/e2e/live/docker tiers, 70% coverage), valora.ai (8 test suites), memU (80% coverage target), 2ndBrain (65% coverage gate), review-flow (stubs + factories), seline (unit + integration split configs), LocalAI (unit/integration/e2e/AIO tiers)
- **Relevance to roxabi:** Roxabi runs all tests in a single vitest invocation. There is no coverage threshold enforced in CI. No separate architecture or security test suites exist.
- **Recommended action:** (1) Enforce a 70% coverage threshold in vitest config. (2) Split vitest configs into `vitest.unit.config.ts` (fast, every commit) and `vitest.integration.config.ts` (full, PRs only). (3) Add `tests/stubs/` and `tests/factories/` conventions.

### Theme 6: Scope-Aware CI and PR Quality Gates

- **Pattern:** Advanced CI pipelines detect what changed (docs-only, platform-specific) and skip irrelevant expensive jobs. PR-level quality gates enforce Conventional Commits on PR titles (not just commit messages) and validate link integrity in docs.
- **Seen in:** OpenClaw (docs-only skip, platform detection, slowest-test reporting), memU (PR title linting), LocalAI (PR lint, path-based labeling, 28 workflows), nanoclaw (skills-only PR enforcement)
- **Relevance to roxabi:** Roxabi's CI runs all jobs on every push regardless of change scope. PR titles are not validated. No link auditing exists for the docs site.
- **Recommended action:** (1) Add `dorny/paths-filter` to CI and skip build/test for docs-only changes. (2) Add PR title Conventional Commits enforcement via `action-semantic-pull-request`. (3) Add a docs link audit script.

### Theme 7: AI Provider Abstraction and Cost Observability

- **Pattern:** Repos building AI features use a provider abstraction layer (litellm, Vercel AI SDK, custom wrappers) to avoid vendor lock-in, and wrap providers with cost/token tracking.
- **Seen in:** nanobot (litellm for 50+ providers), seline (Vercel AI SDK v6), ClawWork (TrackedProvider), memU (multi-LLM profiles), OpenClaw (multi-provider with failover), ClawRouter (14-dim routing + cost optimization)
- **Relevance to roxabi:** Roxabi has no AI provider abstraction. When AI features are added, hardcoding a single provider will create vendor lock-in and invisible costs.
- **Recommended action:** When AI features are added to roxabi, adopt Vercel AI SDK (`@ai-sdk/*`) as the standard provider abstraction. Add a TrackedProvider wrapper for token/cost observability. Design multi-LLM profiles (fast/cheap for simple tasks, capable/expensive for complex reasoning).

### Theme 8: Skills-as-Markdown and Declarative Agent Configuration

- **Pattern:** Agent capabilities are defined as markdown instruction files (SKILL.md, skill files) injected into LLM context rather than code. Personas, instructions, and memory are stored as human-editable markdown in workspace directories.
- **Seen in:** nanobot (SKILL.md zero-code extensions, SOUL.md persona, HEARTBEAT.md tasks), nanoclaw (skills-over-features philosophy, skills-only CI enforcement), OpenClaw (skills marketplace), review-flow (skill invocation model), aidd (slash-command markdown files), valora.ai (structured agent definitions with YAML frontmatter)
- **Relevance to roxabi:** Roxabi already uses `.claude/skills/` with SKILL.md files. The pattern is validated across multiple repos. What roxabi lacks: (1) CI enforcement that skill PRs don't modify source code, (2) a structured skill template with schema validation, (3) the HEARTBEAT.md periodic task pattern.
- **Recommended action:** (1) Add a `skills-only.yml` CI workflow. (2) Add a `SKILL.md.template` with structured frontmatter. (3) Evaluate the HEARTBEAT.md pattern for scheduled AI tasks.

### Theme 9: Comprehensive README as Onboarding Surface

- **Pattern:** The highest-star repos treat the README as the primary onboarding surface with demo GIFs, comparison tables, architecture diagrams, and "when NOT to use this" sections.
- **Seen in:** ClawWork (animated GIF + live demo), safeclaw (comparison table + architecture diagram), nanobot (3-step quick start), OpenClaw (multi-platform install paths), memU (benchmark results + 6-language translations), nanoclaw (token count badge + FAQ)
- **Relevance to roxabi:** Roxabi's README is functional but text-heavy. It does not show the product running, does not compare against alternatives, and does not include an architecture overview.
- **Recommended action:** Add a demo GIF or screenshot to README, a comparison table vs alternatives, and a "when to use / when not to use" section.

## Gaps Identified in Roxabi

These are areas where roxabi is **consistently weaker** than the analyzed repos.

### Security

- **No security scanning in CI.** 6 of 16 repos have some form of security scanning (detect-secrets, Gosec, security test suites). Roxabi has none.
- **No SECURITY.md or threat model documentation.** Repos like nanoclaw and safeclaw document their threat models with trust-level tables and honest known limitations. Roxabi has no equivalent.
- **No SSRF protection.** For any feature that makes outbound HTTP requests (webhooks, integrations, crawling), there is no URL validation against private IP ranges or metadata endpoints.

### Testing Discipline

- **No coverage threshold enforced in CI.** 5 repos enforce explicit coverage gates (65-80%). Roxabi runs coverage but has no enforced minimum -- coverage can silently regress.
- **No architecture test suite.** 2 repos use arch-unit-ts to automatically verify layer direction and module boundaries. Roxabi relies entirely on code review.
- **No test stubs/factories convention.** Roxabi's tests lack reusable test data builders and fake implementations. review-flow's `tests/stubs/` + `tests/factories/` pattern is more disciplined.
- **No separate test tiers.** Unit and integration tests run in a single pass. No way to run fast unit tests in &lt;30s on every commit and reserve slower tests for PRs.

### CI/CD Maturity

- **No scope-aware CI.** Every push runs all jobs regardless of whether only docs changed. OpenClaw's docs-only skip saves significant CI cost and latency.
- **No PR title validation.** Commitlint runs on commit-msg (local hook), but squash-merge PR titles bypass this. No CI enforcement.
- **No automated release pipeline.** Changelog entries are manual. No `release-please` or equivalent. 6 repos have fully automated release pipelines.

### AI-Agent Tooling

- **No token budget for CLAUDE.md.** The file is growing unboundedly. TrigMem provides quantitative reasoning for why this is expensive (every message re-reads the full file).
- **No LLM-optimized doc index.** Agents navigating roxabi's large docs/ tree have no pre-structured overview file.
- **No AI provider abstraction.** When AI features are added, there is no standard SDK integration or cost tracking mechanism.
- **No MCP client integration.** MCP is becoming the standard for AI tool ecosystems. Roxabi has no MCP client.

### Documentation

- **No PR template.** Contributors creating PRs via GitHub's web UI have no structured template guiding them to include description, testing steps, and change type.
- **No docs link auditing.** Broken internal links in the MDX docs site are not caught automatically.
- **No dead dependency detection.** Unused packages in `package.json` accumulate silently. No `knip` or equivalent.
