title: "Talks Presentation v2 — Process-First Playbook Refresh"
description: Update the /talks/claude-code presentation with refreshed narrative, updated stats, new Toolchain section, Lessons Learned replacing Tips, and call-to-action closing.
status: draft
---

## Context

The `/talks/claude-code` presentation was built in mid-February 2026 as a conference companion page. Since then, the development process has evolved significantly — new skills, a mature bootstrap pipeline, and 1,930 sessions of real usage data. The presentation needs a narrative refresh from "introducing Claude Code" to a **process-first practical playbook**.

**Promoted from:** [Talks Presentation v2 Update Analysis](../analyses/talks-presentation-v2-update)

**Tier: F-full** — Narrative rework + section restructure + new components across a single domain.

**Size: M** — 2 new section components, 1 deleted, ~60 i18n keys changed, ~8 existing components updated.

---

## Goal

Deliver an updated 9-section presentation at `/talks/claude-code` that:

- Shifts the narrative from "introducing Claude Code" to "here's exactly how we ship features — and how you can too"
- Updates all stats to real numbers (1,930 sessions, 301K messages, 519 commits)
- Adds a new **Toolchain** section showing 16 skills organized by workflow phase
- Replaces **Tips** with **Lessons Learned** (works / doesn't / changed)
- Updates the **End-to-End** pipeline to show the full evolved flow with human gates
- Closes with a **call to action** — docs, repo, try `/bootstrap`

---

## Users &amp; Use Cases

| User | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Presenter (Mickael) | Navigate the updated presentation during a live talk using keyboard/scroll |
| Developer (audience) | Reference the process and skill ecosystem after the talk |
| Tech lead (audience) | Share with team to evaluate AI-assisted development adoption |
| CTO (audience) | Scan updated stats and pipeline to assess ROI |

---

## Expected Behavior

### Happy path

1. User navigates to `/talks/claude-code`. Page loads with existing full-screen layout.
2. **Section 1 (Intro)** — Updated stat counters animate: **1,930** sessions, **519** commits, **88%** completion.
3. **Section 2 (Building Blocks)** — Shows **16 Skills** (corrected from 15), lists actual skills: `review`, `bootstrap`, `scaffold`, `pr`, `promote`, `test` as primary 6, `+10 more` badge.
4. **Section 3 (Specialization)** — Same structure, minor example refresh.
5. **Section 4 (Dev Process)** — Same tier visualization, no content changes needed.
6. **Section 5 (Toolchain)** — NEW. Horizontal pipeline diagram with 5 phases (Plan → Build → Review → Ship → Maintain). Under each phase, skill nodes are listed as badges. Scroll-triggered animation reveals phases left-to-right.
7. **Section 6 (Agent Teams)** — Same orchestrator model and categories. The "Honest Take" subsection is **removed** from here (moved to Lessons Learned).
8. **Section 7 (End-to-End)** — Updated pipeline with full flow: `/interview` → `/bootstrap` (analysis gate) → `/bootstrap` (spec gate) → `/scaffold` → `/pr` → `/review` + `/1b1` → Merge → `/promote`. Human gate icons at each approval point.
9. **Section 8 (Lessons Learned)** — NEW (replaces Tips). Three-column layout: **What works** (subagents, specialization, fresh reviewers), **What doesn't** (multi-panel teams, orchestrator writing code, generalist agents), **What changed** (bootstrap evolved, skill ecosystem grew, process matured).
10. **Section 9 (Closing)** — Call to action: "Explore the docs" link, "Fork the repo" link, "Try `/bootstrap` on your first feature."
11. PresentationNav shows 9 dots, keyboard nav works with 1-9 keys.

### Edge cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Mobile viewport (&lt;768px) | Same as today — no scroll-snap, single column, dots hidden |
| `prefers-reduced-motion` | All animations disabled — content renders immediately |
| Old section anchors (`#tips`) | No longer valid — acceptable, presentation is not deep-linked externally |
| PresentationNav overflow with 9 dots | Dots are small (8px) with 12px gap — 9 dots = ~180px, fits comfortably on any viewport height |

---

## Constraints

- **No new npm packages.** Reuse existing `@repo/ui`, `lucide-react`, `tailwindcss-animate`.
- **Existing component patterns.** New sections follow `SectionContainer` + `AnimatedSection` patterns.
- **i18n required.** All new text goes through Paraglide messages (en.json + fr.json). No hardcoded strings in components.
- **Presentation stays at `/talks/claude-code`.** No URL changes.
- **No backend changes.** Frontend only (`apps/web/`).

---

## Non-goals

- **Redesigning the visual language** — keep existing scroll-snap, card, glow aesthetic
- **Adding interactive elements** — no code playgrounds, no live demos
- **Changing the component architecture** — keep `components/presentation/` pattern
- **Updating the test file** (`claude-code.test.tsx`) — will need test updates but as a follow-up
- **Speaker notes or export** — web-only presentation

---

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Section order change

New order in `claude-code.tsx` sections array:

```
intro → building-blocks → specialization → dev-process → toolchain → agent-teams → end-to-end → lessons → closing
```

The `toolchain` section goes after Dev Process (natural flow: "here are the tiers" → "here are the tools for each phase"). Lessons Learned goes after End-to-End (natural flow: "here's how it works" → "here's what we learned").

### 2. ToolchainSection: pipeline diagram layout

Horizontal 5-column layout (desktop) with phase headers and skill badges underneath:

```
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌──────────┐
│  Plan    │→ │  Build   │→ │ Review  │→ │  Ship   │→ │ Maintain  │
├─────────┤  ├─────────┤  ├─────────┤  ├─────────┤  ├──────────┤
│/interview│  │/scaffold │  │/review  │  │/pr      │  │/validate │
│/bootstrap│  │/test     │  │/1b1     │  │/promote │  │/retro    │
│/issue-   │  │          │  │         │  │/cleanup │  │/issues   │
│  triage  │  │          │  │         │  │         │  │/agent-   │
│/adr      │  │          │  │         │  │         │  │  browser │
│          │  │          │  │         │  │         │  │/compress │
└─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └──────────┘
```

On mobile: stacked vertically. Each phase is a Card with colored top border. Skills are Badges.

### 3. LessonsLearnedSection: three-column layout

Three Cards side by side (desktop), stacked (mobile):

| What works | What doesn't | What changed |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Subagents via Task tool | Multi-panel Agent Teams | Bootstrap: interview → analysis → spec with gates |
| Specialized agents + domain docs | Orchestrator writing code | 16 skills (was 0 → 15 → 16) |
| Fresh reviewers catch author blind spots | Generalist agents | Human gates at every decision point |

### 4. EndToEndSection: add /interview + human gates

Update the `getPipelineSteps()` function to include `/interview` as the first step (Idea → Analysis). Add visual human gate indicators (shield icon or similar) on steps marked `isGate: true`.

### 5. Skills array correction

Replace in `BuildingBlocksSection.tsx`:

```typescript
// OLD — wrong: includes 'commit' (doesn't exist), 'context7' (plugin)
const skills = ['commit', 'review', 'bootstrap', ...] // 15 items

// NEW — correct: actual skills from .claude/skills/
const skills = [
  'review', 'bootstrap', 'scaffold', 'pr', 'promote', 'test',
  'interview', 'issues', 'issue-triage', '1b1', 'adr',
  'cleanup', 'retro', 'validate', 'compress', 'agent-browser',
] as const // 16 items
```

### 6. Delete TipsSection + DashboardMockup

`TipsSection.tsx` and `DashboardMockup.tsx` are no longer needed — remove both files. All `talk_tips_*` i18n keys become orphans and should be removed.
