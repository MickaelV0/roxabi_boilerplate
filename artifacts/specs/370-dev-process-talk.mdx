title: "Dev Process Deep-Dive Talk"
issue: 370
status: approved
tier: F-lite
date: 2026-02-26
---

## Context

**Promoted from:** [Frame: dev-process-talk](../frames/dev-process-talk.mdx)

The first talk (`/talks/claude-code`) covers the Roxabi boilerplate broadly — skills, agents, CLAUDE.md, tiers, quality gates, and the end-to-end pipeline at a high level. This second talk zooms into the dev process itself: walking through each phase and step, explaining goals/artifacts/gates, showcasing the tier system, resumability, human gates, the compressor skill, custom tooling (`:3333` dashboard), multi-agent A/B patterns, and the plugin ecosystem (MCP, knowledge plugins).

## Goal

Deliver a 15-section scroll-snap presentation at `/talks/dev-process` that teaches the audience the full dev process step-by-step — from issue triage to cleanup — including custom tooling, multi-agent patterns, and the plugin ecosystem, with interactive elements and bilingual support.

## Users

- **Primary:** Conference attendees who saw talk 1 and want the process deep-dive
- **Secondary:** Developers evaluating the boilerplate who need to understand the workflow

## Expected Behavior

### Route & Navigation

- New route at `/talks/dev-process` using TanStack Start `createFileRoute`
- Same layout pattern as `/talks/claude-code`: `data-presentation` wrapper, fixed Roxabi wordmark (top-left), locale switcher + theme toggle (top-right), `PresentationNav` dots
- Scroll-snap container on desktop (`md:snap-y md:snap-mandatory`), stacked on mobile
- Keyboard navigation: number keys 1-9, `0` for section 10, `-` for 11, `=` for 12, arrow keys for 13-15, Escape → `/talks/`
- **Note:** `PresentationNav` in `packages/ui` must be extended to support keys `0`, `-`, `=` (currently only handles 1-9). Sections 13-15 are only reachable via arrow keys or dot clicks — acceptable for a 15-section talk. This is a backward-compatible change — the existing 9-section talk doesn't use these keys.
- Talks index page at `/talks/` listing both talks as cards
- Existing `/talks/claude-code` Escape handler should also be updated to navigate to `/talks/` (currently goes to `/`)

### Section Structure (15 sections)

Each section uses `SectionContainer` + `AnimatedSection` pattern. Components live in `apps/web/src/components/presentation/dev-process/`.

#### Section 1 — Intro

- Badge: "Part 2 — Deep Dive" (or i18n equivalent)
- Title: "The Dev Process"
- Subtitle: "From issue to production — every step, every gate, every artifact"
- 3 stat counters: 15 steps, 5 phases, 4 artifact types (or similar project stats)
- Visual: subtle background glow (reuse pattern from talk 1 IntroSection)

#### Section 2 — Big Picture

- Title: "The Pipeline"
- Visual: horizontal pipeline showing the 5 phases as connected blocks: Frame → Shape → Build → Verify → Ship
- Each phase block shows its steps inside (e.g., Frame contains "triage + frame")
- Desktop: horizontal flow with arrows. Mobile: vertical stack
- Color-coded phases (each phase gets a distinct color, consistent throughout the talk)
- Annotation: "* = conditional step" below

#### Section 3 — Tier System

- Title: "Match Process to Complexity"
- 3-column layout (or 3-row on mobile), one per tier:
  - **S** (green): criteria + phases shown (triage → implement → pr → validate → review)
  - **F-lite** (blue): criteria + phases (frame → spec → plan → implement → verify → ship)
  - **F-full** (purple): criteria + phases (frame → analyze → spec → plan → implement → verify → ship)
- Skip matrix visual: a grid/table showing which steps each tier runs/skips
- Key insight callout: "File count alone doesn't determine tier. A 50-file mechanical change may be S, while a 3-file rate limiter is F-full."
- Annotation: "F-full Shape phase can spawn parallel A/B agents with different prompts/skills — see Section 10"

#### Section 4 — Frame Phase (Triage + Frame)

- Phase header with color indicator
- Two sub-cards:
  - **Triage**: Goal = categorize and assign. Artifact = GitHub issue with labels. Gate = issue exists.
  - **Frame**: Goal = define the problem clearly. Artifact = `artifacts/frames/{slug}.mdx`. Gate = user approves frame.
- Visual: show a mini frame artifact preview (problem, who, constraints, scope, tier)
- Annotation: "S-tier skips framing — goes straight to implement"

#### Section 5 — Shape Phase (Analyze + Spec)

- Two sub-cards:
  - **Analyze** (F-full only badge): Goal = deep technical exploration. Artifact = `artifacts/analyses/{N}-{slug}.mdx`. Gate = user approves analysis.
  - **Spec**: Goal = define what we'll build. Artifact = `artifacts/specs/{N}-{slug}.mdx`. Gate = user approves spec. Key elements: acceptance criteria, breadboard, slices.
- Visual: show spec structure preview (goal, users, expected behavior, success criteria checkboxes)
- Annotation: "F-lite skips analysis — frame is sufficient context for spec"

#### Section 6 — Build Phase (Plan + Implement + PR)

- Three sub-cards:
  - **Plan**: Goal = break into tasks, pick agents. Artifact = `artifacts/plans/{N}-{slug}.mdx`. Gate = user approves plan.
  - **Implement**: Goal = write code. Shows worktree creation, test-first flow (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR), agent routing table. Callout: "`:3333` dashboard gives live visibility into issue status during implementation — see Section 9"
  - **PR**: Goal = package work for review. Shows `gh pr create` flow.
- Visual: agent routing mini-table (change type → agent)
- Annotation: "Test-first: tester writes failing tests, then domain agents implement"

#### Section 7 — Verify Phase (Validate + Review + Fix)

- Three sub-cards:
  - **Validate**: Goal = run all quality gates. Shows lint + typecheck + test checklist.
  - **Review**: Goal = fresh eyes on code. Shows multi-domain review agents (security, architect, product, tester, domain). Key point: no agent reviews code it wrote.
  - **Fix**: Goal = apply accepted findings. Shows auto-apply + 1b1 walkthrough + parallel domain fixers.
- Visual: review agent cards with Conventional Comments example
- Annotation: "Fresh agents = no implementation bias"

#### Section 8 — Ship Phase (Promote + Cleanup)

- Two sub-cards:
  - **Promote**: Goal = staging → main. Shows version bump, changelog, release PR. Note: standalone via `/promote`, not auto-triggered by `/dev`.
  - **Cleanup**: Goal = remove stale worktrees/branches. Shows `git worktree remove` flow.
- Visual: staging → main merge diagram
- Annotation: "Promotion batches all staging changes into one release"

#### Section 9 — Custom Tooling

- Title: "Tooling the Workflow"
- Subtitle: "Claude Code uses *your* tools, not just its own"
- **`:3333` Issue Dashboard card**: live view of issues, status, dependencies, and backlog — runs alongside `bun run dev`. Show a screenshot/mockup of the dashboard UI. Key message: visibility without context-switching.
- **MCP tools card**: Claude Code connects to external tools via MCP servers. Examples: GitHub (`gh` CLI), Vercel API, Postgres. Agents call these tools just like any other tool — no special wiring needed.
- **Custom CLI tooling card**: aliases, tmux layouts, `dev:clean`, `db:branch:create` — show how the local dev environment is itself a tool that agents can drive.
- **Key principle callout**: "Agents don't just write code — they operate your entire toolchain"
- Add `talk_dp_tools_*` i18n keys

#### Section 10 — Multi-Agent Patterns

- Title: "Agents as Perspectives"
- Subtitle: "Same brief, different minds — pick the best result"
- **A/B landing page demo** (the headline example):
  - Same spec → 2 agents spawned in parallel with different skills: `frontend-design` vs `ui-ux-pro-max`
  - Show the `TeamCreate` → `TaskCreate` → parallel `Task` spawn flow (pseudocode / diagram)
  - Both agents produce a landing page variant → human compares and picks
  - Key insight: agents aren't interchangeable workers, they have **distinct aesthetic and technical perspectives**
- **Other patterns** (smaller cards):
  - **Parallel domains**: frontend-dev + backend-dev + tester working the same issue concurrently, coordinating via shared task list
  - **Fresh reviewer**: no agent reviews code it wrote — always a different agent for review
  - **Escalation**: agent hits a blocker → creates follow-up task → notifies lead
- **Coordination primitives** reminder: `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `SendMessage`, `blockedBy`
- Add `talk_dp_multi_*` i18n keys

#### Section 11 — Plugin Ecosystem

- Title: "Plugins: More Than Skills"
- Subtitle: "A plugin is a full capability bundle — not a slash command"
- **Plugin anatomy card** (the key distinction):
  - Skill = one slash command (`/commit`, `/review`)
  - Plugin = agents + skills + hooks + MCP servers + settings + memory — all packaged together
  - Show `.claude-plugin` manifest structure (small code block)
- **Three plugin type cards**:
  1. **Workflow plugins** — e.g., the Roxabi boilerplate itself: skills like `/dev`, `/promote`, agents like `product-lead`, hooks like the Biome formatter
  2. **Integration plugins** — connect Claude to external systems (GitHub, Linear, Vercel, Slack) via MCP tools
  3. **Knowledge plugins** — inject live documentation into agent context (Context7, Vercel docs MCP). Before/after callout: "Without Context7: agent uses training data (may be stale). With Context7: agent fetches current docs at query time."
- **Anthropic plugin marketplace callout**: highlight that plugins are discoverable and composable — you can stack multiple plugins in one project
- Add `talk_dp_plugins_*` i18n keys

#### Section 12 — Resumability & Artifact Model

- Title: "Pick Up Where You Left Off"
- Visual: `/dev #42` scanning state — show the artifact scan process as an animated checklist
- Show the Sigma (state map) concept: each step maps to an artifact or session state
- Key point: sessions can die and resume — `/dev #N` re-scans artifacts and continues
- Example: show a partially completed progress bar, then "Session dies → restart → same progress"
- 4 artifact types visual: Frame (problem), Analysis (depth), Spec (solution), Plan (tasks)

#### Section 13 — Human Gates

- Title: "You Decide, AI Executes"
- Visual: pipeline with gate icons at each human approval point
- Key gates listed: frame approval, spec approval, plan approval, review comment acceptance, merge decision
- `AskUserQuestion` pattern callout — every phase transition requires explicit user approval
- Counter-narrative: "Not fully autonomous — intentionally human-in-the-loop"
- Principle: "Human decides, Claude orchestrates, agents specialize"

#### Section 14 — Compressor Skill

- Title: "Compress: Less Tokens, Same Semantics"
- Intro text: explains what the compressor does (formal notation rewrite)
- Shows the symbol legend: `∀` `∃` `∈` `¬` `→` `⟺` etc.
- **Interactive slider-wipe demo**: a draggable vertical divider with "Before" (verbose prose) on the left and "After" (compressed formal notation) on the right
  - Generic example: ~15 lines of verbose skill prose → ~6 lines of compressed notation
  - Stats bar below: "Lines: 45 → 18 | -60% | Tokens: -55%"
  - Draggable divider with grab handle, touch-friendly
  - Desktop: starts with divider at center. Mobile: toggle tabs fallback (Before/After)
- Annotation: "Every skill and agent in this project is compressed"

#### Section 15 — Closing

- Title: "Build Your Process"
- 4 CTA cards:
  - "Explore the Docs" → link to docs
  - "Fork the Repo" → link to GitHub
  - "Try `/dev #1`" → the single entry point message
  - "Browse Plugins" → link to Anthropic plugin marketplace
- Subtle background glow (mirror intro section)

### Talks Index Page

New page at `/talks/` (route: `apps/web/src/routes/talks/index.tsx`) with:
- Title: "Talks"
- 2 cards linking to each talk:
  - Card 1: "Claude Code" — subtitle, thumbnail/icon, link to `/talks/claude-code`
  - Card 2: "The Dev Process" — subtitle, thumbnail/icon, link to `/talks/dev-process`

### i18n

All text uses Paraglide messages from `@/paraglide/messages`:
- Key prefix: `talk_dp_` for the dev-process talk (vs `talk_` for claude-code talk)
- Nav keys: `talk_dp_nav_intro`, `talk_dp_nav_big_picture`, etc.
- Section keys: `talk_dp_intro_badge`, `talk_dp_intro_title`, etc.
- Both `en.json` and `fr.json` updated simultaneously

### Slider Wipe Component

New component: `CompressionDemo.tsx` in `apps/web/src/components/presentation/dev-process/`

**Props:**
- `beforeContent: string` — verbose prose text
- `afterContent: string` — compressed notation text
- `stats: { linesBefore: number, linesAfter: number, tokenReduction: string }`

**Behavior:**
- Two absolutely positioned panels, clipped via `clip-path: inset()` (GPU-accelerated, no layout reflow on drag)
- Divider: vertical line with a grab handle (centered circle with grip dots)
- Left panel: monospace text with "Before" label, right panel: monospace with "After" label
- Mouse drag + touch drag supported. Apply `user-select: none` on panel content during active drag to prevent text selection.
- Initial position: 50%
- Mobile fallback: two tabs (Before / After) with stats bar below
- Accessible: divider has `role="slider"`, `aria-valuemin={0}`, `aria-valuemax={100}`, `aria-valuenow={position}`. Arrow keys move divider.

**Example content:** Generic verbose skill prose (~15 lines) compressed to formal notation (~6 lines). Exact content to be authored during implementation — stats derived from actual content, not hardcoded.
