## Scope

Phase 2 frontend — Sentry React integration with ErrorBoundary wiring. Breadboard IDs: U1, U2a, U2b.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `@sentry/react` initialized in `apps/web/src/lib/sentry/` when `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` is set
- [ ] Sentry `release` set to `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`; `environment` from `VERCEL_ENV`
- [ ] Root + Docs ErrorBoundaries wire `onError` → `Sentry.captureException()`
- [ ] Admin ErrorBoundary (TanStack `errorComponent`) calls `Sentry.captureException(error)` directly in component body
- [ ] Frontend errors appear in Sentry with browser context
- [ ] Sentry disabled gracefully when `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` not set
- [ ] `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_PROJECT_WEB` added to `.env.example`
