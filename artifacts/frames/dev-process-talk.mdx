title: Dev Process Deep-Dive Talk

## Problem

The existing Claude Code talk introduces the boilerplate broadly — skills, agents, CLAUDE.md, and the dev process at a high level. Audience members who want to understand **how the process actually works step-by-step** have no resource for that. The dev process is the core differentiator of this project (structured AI-assisted development with human gates), but it's currently compressed into a single section of talk 1.

A dedicated talk is needed to walk through each phase and step in detail: what's the goal, what happens, what artifacts are produced, and where human approval is required. This also provides an opportunity to showcase the compressor skill with an interactive before/after demo — a tangible example of the kind of tooling the process enables.

## Who

- **Primary:** Conference attendees who saw talk 1 and want the deeper process story
- **Secondary:** Developers evaluating the boilerplate for adoption who need to understand the workflow before committing

## Constraints

- No deadline or special timeline pressure
- Must support both English and French (i18n from day one, like talk 1)
- Reuse existing presentation infrastructure (`SectionContainer`, `PresentationNav`, `AnimatedSection`, `@repo/ui` components)
- Same scroll-snap format as `/talks/claude-code` for consistency
- 12 sections — longer than talk 1's 9, but each phase section groups 2-3 steps together

## Out of Scope

- No speaker notes or PDF export functionality
- No live coding / embedded terminal demos
- No changes to the existing claude-code talk
- No new shared UI components beyond what's needed for the compressor before/after demo

## Complexity

**Tier: F-lite** — Clear scope, single frontend domain, well-defined 12-section structure reusing existing presentation patterns. The only novel element is the interactive before/after compression component.

Signals observed:
- Single domain (frontend only — route, components, i18n)
- Reuses existing infrastructure (SectionContainer, PresentationNav, AnimatedSection)
- No new architecture patterns or cross-domain concerns
- Well-defined section list from issue body
- One new interactive component (before/after compression demo)
