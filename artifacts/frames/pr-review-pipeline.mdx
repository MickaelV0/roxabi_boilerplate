## Problem

The current `/review` skill requires manual invocation — a developer must explicitly run it after creating or updating a PR. This creates friction: reviews get skipped, forgotten, or run too late in the cycle. When fixes are pushed after a review, there's no automated check to verify that findings were actually addressed, requiring another manual round-trip.

The goal is to make code review a first-class automated step in the PR lifecycle: triggered on PR open/push, results surfaced as contextual inline comments (not a single summary blob), and follow-up reviews that close the loop when fixes land.

## Who

- **Primary:** Developers opening or updating PRs — they benefit from automatic review feedback without needing to remember to invoke `/review`, and get contextual inline comments on the exact diff lines.
- **Secondary:** Reviewers / maintainers — PR threads auto-resolve when findings are verified fixed, reducing noise in the review interface.

## Constraints

- **GitHub Actions only** — no self-hosted server, no external persistence. Webhook triggers must run in ephemeral CI runners.
- **GitHub only** — no GitLab or other VCS support.
- **Builds on existing `/review` skill** — no replacement, no duplication. The pipeline wraps and invokes what already exists.
- **Deduplication required** — rapid pushes must not trigger duplicate concurrent reviews (queue or concurrency lock in the workflow).
- **Stack:** Bun, TypeScript, GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`), `gh` CLI for PR comment/thread APIs.

## Out of Scope

- GitLab or Bitbucket support.
- Self-hosted persistent review server (ReviewFlow's architecture) — GitHub Actions ephemeral runners only.
- Replacing or modifying the existing `/review` skill internals.
- ReviewFlow's skill template system (we have our own).
- Dashboard integration (Progress visibility / `:3333` listed in issue as optional — deferred).
- Real-time streaming progress during review (GitHub Actions log is sufficient for now).

## Complexity

**Tier: F-lite** — Clear scope within a single domain (CI automation + PR API). Five well-defined features, no architectural unknowns, leverages existing `/review` skill with a GitHub Actions wrapper layer.

Signals observed:
- Single domain: GitHub Actions + PR lifecycle automation.
- Existing foundation: `/review` skill already handles multi-agent review logic.
- Defined acceptance criteria and out-of-scope in issue body.
- No new arch patterns required beyond a GitHub Actions workflow + `gh api` calls.
- Inline comment API and thread resolution are well-documented GitHub features.
