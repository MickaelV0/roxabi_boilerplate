title: Atomic Workflow Orchestrator (/dev)
issue: 364
status: approved
tier: F-full

## Problem

The current dev workflow requires manually chaining 4 monolithic skills (`/bootstrap` → `/scaffold` → `/review` → `/promote`). Each skill does too much internally, making it impossible to:
- **Resume** — if a session dies mid-scaffold, you restart the whole skill
- **Skip** — can't skip analysis if framing was thorough enough
- **Reuse** — can't run just `/spec` independently without bootstrapping
- **Track** — no quick way to see "where am I" on a given issue

The user must remember which skill to call next and what arguments to pass.

## Who

- **Primary:** The developer (sole user) working with Claude Code agents daily
- **Secondary:** Claude Code agents that get delegated work by the orchestrator

## Constraints

- **Fast start** — `/dev #42` must show current state in <5 seconds (artifact scanning, not database)
- **No state file** — artifacts ARE the state; no `.workflow.json` to maintain
- **Backward compatible** — existing artifacts (analyses, specs, plans) must be recognized
- **Reuse existing skills** — step skills call into existing skill logic where possible (don't rewrite review, promote, etc.)
- **2-level only** — Orchestrator → Step skills. No phase-level middlemen.
- **AskUserQuestion at gates** — orchestrator pauses between phases, never auto-advances to a new phase
- **Primary entry point** — `/dev` is the recommended path; step skills are also user-invocable for power users

## Out of scope

- Multi-issue orchestration (one `/dev` session = one issue)
- Persistent dashboard / web UI for workflow state
- Automatic tier detection without user confirmation
- Parallel step execution (steps are sequential within a session)
- Rewriting the internals of existing skills (validate, promote, cleanup, etc.)

## Complexity

**To determine:** This touches skill architecture across the whole `.claude/skills/` directory.
- Creates 1 new orchestrator + 1 new skill (`/frame`)
- Extracts 5 step skills from 2 monoliths (`/bootstrap`, `/scaffold`)
- Simplifies 1 existing skill (`/review`)
- Modifies 2 docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `dev-process.mdx`)

Likely **F-full**: multiple domains (skill system, artifacts, docs), new architecture pattern.

## Decisions

1. **Step skills are user-invocable** — `/frame`, `/analyze`, `/spec`, `/plan`, `/implement`, `/fix` can all be called directly. `/dev` is the recommended entry point but not the only one.
2. **Auto-detect tier + confirm** — Read issue size label / frame complexity field, present to user, confirm or override.
3. **Frame has approval gate** — After writing the frame, `/dev` shows it and asks user to approve before proceeding to Shape.
4. **Review simplification** — Remove auto-apply + 1b1 from `/review`. Those are now `/fix` + `/1b1`. Review just produces findings.
5. **Keep `/bootstrap` and `/scaffold` as aliases** — They redirect to `/dev` at the appropriate phase. Remove after transition period.
