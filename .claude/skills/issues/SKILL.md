# Issues

List open GitHub issues from the project board with their Status, Size, Priority, and dependency relationships.

## Instructions

1. **Run the script** to fetch issues:
   ```bash
   .claude/skills/issues/fetch_issues.sh
   ```

2. **Present the output in a code block**: Wrap the script output in triple backticks (```). Do NOT reformat or interpret the data - the script already produces a well-formatted table.

3. **Add brief recommendations** (2-3 lines max) based on what you see:
   - Issues with ✅ and high priority (P0/P1) should be prioritized
   - Issues missing Size or Priority need triage (suggest `/issue-triage`)
   - Identify the critical blocker if many issues are blocked

4. **Show work in progress** by running these commands and presenting their output:
   ```bash
   # Worktrees (parallel workspaces)
   git worktree list

   # Feature branches (exclude main/master)
   git branch --list | grep -v -E '^\*?\s*(main|master)$'

   # Open PRs
   gh pr list --state open
   ```

   Present this as a "Work in Progress" section after recommendations:
   - Show worktrees if any exist beyond the main one
   - Show feature branches that may relate to issues (look for issue numbers in branch names)
   - Show open PRs with their status (draft, review, etc.)

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| (none) | Table output sorted by Priority, then Size |
| `--json` | Raw JSON output for programmatic use |
| `--priority` | Sort by priority (default) |
| `--size` | Sort by size instead |
| `--title-length=N` | Truncate titles at N chars (default: 55) |

## Output Columns

|--------|-------------|
| `#` | Issue number |
| `Title` | Issue title with children as tree (├/└) |
| `Status` | Todo, In Progress, Done |
| `Size` | XS, S, M, L, XL |
| `Pri` | P0, P1, P2, P3 |
| `⚡` | Block status (see below) |
| `Deps` | Detailed dependency list |

## Block Status (⚡ column)

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `✅` | Ready - no open blockers |
| `⛔` | Blocked - waiting on other issues |
| `🔓` | Blocking - other issues depend on this |

## Dependency Icons (Deps column)

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `⛔#N` | Blocked by issue #N (open) |
| `🔓#N` | Blocks issue #N |
| `✅#N` | Was blocked by #N (now closed) |
