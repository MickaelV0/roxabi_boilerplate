[test]
# Disable Bun's built-in test runner to avoid conflicts with Vitest
# Use `bun run test` (which runs turbo test -> vitest) instead of `bun test`
#
# This project uses Vitest for testing, configured per-package via vitest.config.ts
# Running `bun test` would use Bun's built-in runner which:
# - Ignores vitest.config.ts files
# - Doesn't set up jsdom environment for React tests
# - Picks up Playwright e2e files causing conflicts
#
# Correct command: bun run test

# Set root to a non-existent path to prevent bun test from finding files
root = "./.bun-test-disabled"
