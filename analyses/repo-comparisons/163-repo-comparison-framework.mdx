title: "Brainstorm: Repo Comparison Framework"
description: Repeatable analysis template for comparing public repos against roxabi_boilerplate and 2ndBrain (epic #163)
type: brainstorm
---

## Trigger

Epic [#163](https://github.com/roxabi/boilerplate/issues/163) — compare Roxabi Boilerplate against 16 public repositories to identify inspiration, good practices, and actionable improvements. Each sub-issue targets a specific repo. This document defines the **repeatable framework** every analysis must follow.

## How to Use This Template

1. **Create one brainstorm document per repo** in `analyses/repo-comparisons/{issue}-{slug}.mdx`
2. **Source data** using the hybrid approach: start with GitHub API / web, clone locally if the repo is complex
3. **Rate each axis** using the traffic light system (see below)
4. **Link back** to the GitHub sub-issue in the Context section
5. **All 16 analyses** will later be consolidated into a single summary document

## Traffic Light Rating System

Ratings are **relative to roxabi_boilerplate**:

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `🟢` Green | They do it better than roxabi — we should learn from this |
| `🟡` Yellow | Comparable or different approach — worth noting but no clear winner |
| `🔴` Red | Roxabi does it better, or they don't have it at all |
| `⚪` N/A | Not applicable to this repo (e.g., no CI/CD for a rules-only repo) |

### 8. CI/CD Pipelines `{rating}`

- Pipeline platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Stages and checks (lint, type, test, build, deploy)
- Branch protection and merge rules
- Deployment strategy (preview, staging, production)
- Secrets management in CI

### 9. Documentation Quality `{rating}`

- README quality and completeness

- Tools or integrations worth exploring

### 11. What They Do Better Than roxabi_boilerplate

- Specific areas where this repo clearly outperforms roxabi
- Concrete examples with file paths or links
- Actionable suggestions for what roxabi should adopt

### 12. What They Do Better Than 2ndBrain

- Specific areas where this repo outperforms 2ndBrain
- Concrete examples with file paths or links
- Cross-reference with roxabi comparison (are the strengths the same?)

### 13. Key Takeaways

- Top 3-5 actionable items to bring back to roxabi
- Priority ranking (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Links to potential GitHub issues to create

## Per-Repo Document Template

Each repo analysis should use this structure:

```
---
title: "Brainstorm: {Repo Name} Analysis"
description: Analysis of {owner}/{repo} for epic #163
type: brainstorm
---

## Context

**GitHub sub-issue:** [#{issue}](https://github.com/roxabi/boilerplate/issues/{issue})
**Repository:** [{owner}/{repo}](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo})
**Stars / Activity:** {stars} stars, last commit {date}

## Summary Table

| Axis | Rating | One-liner |
|------|--------|-----------|
| What it does | {🟢🟡🔴⚪} | {brief} |
| How it works | {🟢🟡🔴⚪} | {brief} |
| Architecture | {🟢🟡🔴⚪} | {brief} |

## What's next?

- Execute all 16 analyses in parallel using this framework
- Each analysis produces a brainstorm doc in `analyses/repo-comparisons/`
- After all analyses are complete, create a consolidated summary comparing all repos
- Extract actionable improvement issues and add them to the roxabi backlog
