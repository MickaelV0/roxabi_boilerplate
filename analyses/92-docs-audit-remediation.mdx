title: "Documentation Audit Remediation"
description: "Analysis of findings M-20 to M-25 from the 2026-02-09 project audit — stale docs fixes and missing guides."

> **Deprecated** — Audit remediation work completed. Superseded by the 2026-02-13 documentation audit.

## Context

The [2026-02-09 project audit](./project-audit-2026-02-09) identified six documentation findings (M-20 through M-25) in the Medium priority tier. This analysis verifies each finding against the current codebase state and defines the remaining work.

**GitHub issue:** #92

## Questions Explored

1. Which of the six audit findings are still valid (vs. already fixed)?
2. What is the correct source-of-truth for each stale doc finding?
3. What content should the two missing guides cover?

## Analysis

### Already Resolved

Two of the four stale-doc findings were fixed in commit `67c8894` (docs: fix inaccuracies across architecture, deployment, config and getting-started):

| Finding | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **M-20**: `JWT_SECRET` in configuration.mdx | **Fixed** | `configuration.mdx:38` now reads `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` |
| **M-21**: Wrong Swagger URL in getting-started.mdx | **Fixed** | `getting-started.mdx:251` now reads `http://localhost:3001/api/docs` |

### Still Open — Stale Doc Fixes

#### M-24: Branch naming conflict

`contributing.mdx:20` uses `feature/&lt;issue-id>-&lt;description>` (e.g., `feature/42-user-auth`).
`dev-process.mdx:140,190,230` consistently uses `feat/XXX-slug` (e.g., `feat/123-user-auth`).

**Source of truth:** `dev-process.mdx` — the development process is the authoritative document. Code, CLAUDE.md, and worktree commands all use `feat/`.

**Fix:** Update `contributing.mdx` branch naming table to match `feat/XXX-slug` pattern. Also align `fix/` and `hotfix/` rows to use the same `&lt;issue-id>-&lt;slug>` format.

#### M-25: Priority label conflict

`contributing.mdx:171-173` defines three priority levels (P1 Critical, P2 High, P3 Medium).
`issue-management.mdx:51-54` defines four priority levels (P0 Urgent, P1 High, P2 Medium, P3 Low).

Additionally, `issue-management.mdx:132-134` has a second table with yet another mapping (P1 Critical, P2 High, P3 Medium) — internally inconsistent within the same file.

**Source of truth:** `issue-management.mdx:51-54` (the primary table) — it matches the actual GitHub labels on the project.

**Fix:**
- Update `contributing.mdx` to use the P0-P3 scale from `issue-management.mdx:51-54`.
- Fix the duplicate table in `issue-management.mdx:132-134` to match its own primary table at lines 51-54.

### Still Open — Missing Guides

#### M-22: Database Architecture Documentation

No `docs/architecture/database.mdx` exists. Developers have no reference for schema conventions, migration workflow, or Drizzle ORM patterns.

**Scope (reference-level):**
- Drizzle ORM setup and provider pattern (`drizzle.provider.ts`)
- Schema conventions: `base.ts` shared timestamps, column naming, table naming
- Auth schema (managed by Better Auth via Drizzle adapter)
- Migration workflow: `drizzle-kit generate` / `drizzle-kit migrate`
- Seed data approach
- Testing with database (nullable in dev, throw in prod pattern)

**Source material:** `apps/api/src/drizzle/`, existing schema files, `drizzle.config.ts`, `backend-patterns.mdx`.

#### M-23: Authentication Guide

No `docs/guides/authentication.mdx` exists. Developers have no reference for how auth works end-to-end.

**Scope (reference-level):**
- Better Auth architecture: `auth.instance.ts` (config) vs `auth.service.ts` (NestJS wrapper)
- Auth guard: global deny-by-default, `@Public()` decorator for opt-out
- `@Roles()` decorator and role-based access
- OAuth providers configuration
- Email provider (Resend) setup
- Session management (cookies, SameSite via Vite proxy)
- Frontend auth client and API calls
- Environment variables: `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, OAuth provider keys

**Source material:** `apps/api/src/auth/`, `apps/web/src/lib/auth-client.ts`, analysis [#19 Auth + Users](./19-auth-users), spec [#19 Auth + Users](../specs/19-auth-users).

## Conclusions

- **4 of 6 findings remain** (2 already fixed by commit 67c8894)
- The two stale-doc fixes are small text edits (~10 lines each)
- The two new guides require reading existing source code and writing reference-level documentation
- Total scope: ~4 files modified/created — fits **Tier M** (matches the issue's `M` size label)

## Next Steps

- Create spec from this analysis to define exact file changes
- Fix `contributing.mdx` branch naming (M-24)
- Fix `contributing.mdx` and `issue-management.mdx` priority labels (M-25)
- Create `docs/architecture/database.mdx` (M-22)
- Create `docs/guides/authentication.mdx` (M-23)
- Remove stale `blocked` label from issue #92
