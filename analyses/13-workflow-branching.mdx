## Executive Summary

Modern Git workflows in 2025-2026 favor **trunk-based development** or **GitHub Flow** over GitFlow for teams practicing continuous delivery, with DORA metrics showing 28% faster delivery times. For a SaaS boilerplate with AI team integration using Bun/TurboRepo, the recommended approach combines GitHub Flow simplicity with Conventional Commits automation, using **Changesets** for monorepo-native release management.

---

## State of the Art (2025-2026)

### Git Branching Strategies

The industry has largely moved away from GitFlow for continuous delivery projects. According to Vincent Driessen (GitFlow's creator): *"If your team is doing continuous delivery of software, I would suggest adopting a much simpler workflow (like GitHub Flow) instead of trying to shoehorn git-flow into your team."*

**Current Trends:**
- Teams using trunk-based development report **28% faster project delivery**
- DORA metrics correlate strongly with trunk-based workflows
- AI-enhanced code reviews and automated branch management are emerging
- Predictive merge conflict resolution tools are gaining traction

### Commit Conventions

**Conventional Commits** has become the de facto standard, enabling:
- Automatic semantic version bumps (`fix:` = PATCH, `feat:` = MINOR, `!` = MAJOR)
- Automated changelog generation
- Clear communication of change intent
- CI/CD pipeline automation

### Release Automation for Monorepos

| Tool | Monorepo Support | Automation Level | Workflow |
|------|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| **Changesets** | Native, first-class | Semi-automated | PR-based changesets |
| **release-please** | Supported | Automated via PR | Commit analysis |
| **semantic-release** | Community plugin (unmaintained) | Fully automated | Commit analysis |

**Key Insight:** Changesets is purpose-built for monorepos and decouples versioning from commits, making it ideal for TurboRepo projects.

### GitHub Templates (YAML Forms)

Modern issue templates use YAML-based forms providing:
- Structured input fields with validation
- Required field enforcement
- Dropdown selections and checkboxes
- Better contributor experience than Markdown templates

### Branch Protection

Best practices include:
- Required PR reviews (minimum 1 reviewer)
- Required status checks (CI must pass)
- Dismiss stale approvals on new commits
- Require conversation resolution
- Require branches to be up-to-date before merging

---

## Options Analysis

### Option A: Fastest to Implement (MVP Approach)

**Description:**
Minimal viable workflow setup focused on getting essentials in place quickly.

**Components:**
- GitHub Flow (feature branches only)
- Basic branch naming: `feature/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`
- Simple Markdown PR template
- Markdown issue templates (bug, feature)
- Basic branch protection on `main`
- Manual versioning (no automation)

**Setup Time:** ~2 hours

**Pros:**
- Extremely fast to implement
- Low learning curve for contributors
- No additional tooling dependencies
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Works immediately

**Cons:**
- No commit message enforcement (quality varies)
- Manual version management (error-prone)
- No automated changelogs
- Limited scalability
- Technical debt accumulates

**Complexity:** 1/5

---

### Option B: Best Quality (Gold Standard)

**Description:**
Full-featured workflow automation with all modern best practices.

**Components:**
- GitHub Flow with Conventional Commits
- Commitlint + Husky for local enforcement
- CI validation of all commit messages
- YAML-based issue forms (bug, feature, epic)
- Multiple PR templates by type
- Changesets for monorepo release management
- Automated changelog generation per package
- Semantic versioning automation
- Full branch protection with rulesets
- Required signed commits
- Merge queue integration (Aviator or GitHub native)
- Automated dependency updates (Renovate)
- PR size limits and automated labeling

**Setup Time:** ~16-24 hours

**Pros:**
- Enterprise-grade workflow
- Full automation reduces human error
- Consistent commit history
- Automatic changelogs and releases
- Scales to large teams
- Professional contributor experience
- Audit trail for compliance

**Cons:**
- Significant initial setup time
- Higher learning curve
- More tooling to maintain
- Potential friction for casual contributors
- Overkill for early-stage projects
- More complex troubleshooting

**Complexity:** 5/5

---

### Option C: Best Balance (Recommended)

**Description:**
Pragmatic approach combining essential automation with reasonable setup effort.

**Components:**

**1. Branching Strategy (GitHub Flow)**
- Main branch: `main` (always deployable)
- Feature branches: `feature/<issue-id>-<short-description>`
- Bug fixes: `fix/<issue-id>-<short-description>`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/<issue-id>-<short-description>`
- Docs: `docs/<description>`

**2. Conventional Commits**
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`
- Scope: package name for monorepo (`feat(web):`, `fix(api):`)
- Breaking changes: `feat!:` or `fix!:` with `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer

**3. Commit Enforcement**
- Commitlint + Husky locally
- CI validation as backup
- Squash merge with conventional commit in PR title

**4. GitHub Templates**
- YAML issue forms: bug report, feature request
- PR template with checklist
- `config.yml` to disable blank issues

**5. Branch Protection**
- Require PR for `main`
- Require 1 approval
- Require status checks to pass
- Dismiss stale approvals
- Require conversation resolution

**6. Release Management**
- Changesets for version management
- Automated changelog per package
- Manual release trigger (controlled)

**7. Labels**
- Priority: `P1`, `P2`, `P3`
- Size: `XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`
- Type: `feature`, `bug`, `docs`, `dx`, `ai`, `workflow`
- Status: `setup`, `blocked`, `needs-review`

**Setup Time:** ~6-8 hours

**Pros:**
- Balances automation with simplicity
- Enforces quality without excessive friction
- Monorepo-native release management
- Reasonable learning curve
- Room to grow
- Industry-standard tooling

**Cons:**
- Some manual steps remain
- Contributors need to learn conventional commits
- Changesets requires PR workflow adjustment

**Complexity:** 3/5

## Comparison Table

| Criteria | Option A (MVP) | Option B (Gold) | Option C (Balanced) |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Setup Speed** | Excellent | Poor | Good |
| **Code Quality** | Basic | Excellent | Very Good |
| **Automation** | None | Full | Moderate |
| **Maintenance** | Low | High | Moderate |
| **Scalability** | Poor | Excellent | Good |
| **Learning Curve** | Low | High | Moderate |
| **Complexity** | 1/5 | 5/5 | 3/5 |

---

## Recommendation

**Recommended: Option C (Best Balance)**

### Justification

1. **Project Stage Fit:** A SaaS boilerplate is meant to be a starting point for future projects. Option C provides enough structure to demonstrate best practices without overwhelming complexity.

2. **Monorepo Alignment:** Changesets is purpose-built for monorepos and integrates seamlessly with TurboRepo's package-based architecture.

3. **AI Team Integration:** The AI agents benefit from consistent commit messages and clear branching patterns for automated code understanding and generation.

4. **Growth Path:** Option C can evolve toward Option B as the project matures, while Option A would require significant rework.

5. **Industry Standard:** The tooling choices (Husky, Commitlint, Changesets) are widely adopted and well-documented.

### Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1 (Immediate):**
   - Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with workflow documentation
   - Set up branch protection rules
   - Create PR template
   - Create issue templates (YAML forms)
   - Add labels

2. **Phase 2 (Short-term):**
   - Install and configure Commitlint + Husky
   - Set up CI validation for commits
   - Configure Changesets

3. **Phase 3 (Optional Enhancement):**
   - Add merge queue if needed
   - Add automated dependency updates
   - Consider PR size limits
