title: "Claude Code & Agent Teams Presentation Page"
description: Standalone full-screen presentation page at /talks/claude-code for a ~30-minute talk introducing Claude Code, its development workflow, and Agent Teams coordination.
status: in-progress
---

## Context

Roxabi uses Claude Code as a parallelized development workforce — not a simple code assistant. Over 16 days, 808 sessions produced 624 commits across 680 hours of compute with an 88% task completion rate. This story needs a proper showcase: a beautiful, standalone presentation-style web page for a ~30-minute live talk.

This is NOT a slide deck exported to HTML. It is a purpose-built web page that acts as a visual companion to a live presentation and doubles as a standalone reading experience.

**Promoted from:** [Claude Code &amp; Agent Teams Presentation Analysis](../analyses/presentation-claude-code)

**Tier: F-lite** — Single domain (frontend only), clear requirements, extends existing patterns.

**Size: M** (1-2 days) — 1 layout route + 1 page route + 10-12 components + 2-3 hooks + CSS.

---

## Goal

Deliver a full-screen presentation page at `/talks/claude-code` that:

- Walks audiences through 7 sections covering Claude Code setup, building blocks, dev process, agent teams, review pipeline, and a live end-to-end example
- Features animated stats from real usage data (808 sessions, 88% completion rate)
- Uses scroll-snap navigation with keyboard support and a section indicator
- Works as both a live presentation companion and a standalone shareable URL
- Requires zero new npm dependencies

---

## Users &amp; Use Cases

| User | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Presenter (Mickael) | Navigate through sections during a ~30-minute live talk using keyboard arrows or scroll |
| Developer (audience) | Read the page after the talk to reference setup instructions, aliases, and architecture details |
| Tech lead (audience) | Share the URL with their team to explain the Claude Code development workflow |
| CTO (audience) | Scan the stats and pipeline overview to evaluate AI-assisted development ROI |

---

## Expected Behavior

### Happy path

1. User navigates to `/talks/claude-code`.
2. The page loads in full-screen mode — no site Header, no footer. A minimal navigation overlay appears: section dots on the right edge and a small "Roxabi" wordmark in the top-left corner.
3. The first section (Introduction) fills the viewport with a hero-style layout: title, subtitle, and animated stat counters.
4. User scrolls down (or presses arrow-down / Page Down). The page scroll-snaps to the next section.
5. Each section occupies exactly one viewport height (`100dvh`). Content within each section uses scroll-triggered reveal animations (fade-up, staggered children).
6. The section dots indicator on the right updates to highlight the current section. Clicking a dot scrolls to that section.
7. Code blocks render with monospace font and syntax highlighting. Some code blocks have a typing animation that plays when scrolled into view.
8. Stat counters (808 sessions, 624 commits, etc.) animate from 0 to their target value when scrolled into view.
9. The Agent Teams section displays 9 agent cards with color-coded borders matching their definitions (cyan for frontend-dev, green for backend-dev, etc.).
10. The End-to-End section shows an animated pipeline flow: `/bootstrap` → `/scaffold` → `/review` → `/pr` → `/promote`.
11. User can press Escape or click the "Roxabi" wordmark to return to the site home page.

### Keyboard navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `ArrowDown` / `PageDown` / `Space` | Scroll to next section |
| `ArrowUp` / `PageUp` | Scroll to previous section |
| `Home` | Scroll to first section |
| `End` | Scroll to last section |
| `Escape` | Navigate back to home page |
| `1`-`7` | Jump to section by number |

### Edge cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Mobile viewport (&lt;768px) | Sections stack vertically without scroll-snap. Section dots hide. Content reflows to single-column. Code blocks get horizontal scroll. |
| Tablet viewport (768px-1024px) | Scroll-snap remains. Two-column layouts collapse to single-column. Section dots remain visible. |
| `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` | All animations disabled — content renders immediately without fade, typing, or counter effects. Scroll-snap still works. |
| User toggles light/dark mode | Page respects the user's theme preference. Works in both light and dark mode. |
| Section content overflows viewport | `SectionContainer` uses `min-h-dvh` (not fixed `h-dvh`) so content can overflow. Scroll-snap still aligns to section tops. |
| Browser without `dvh` support | Falls back to `min-h-screen` (100vh). Acceptable on older browsers. |
| Printing | Not supported — web-only presentation. No print stylesheet needed. |

---

## Constraints

- **No new npm packages.** All animations use CSS + IntersectionObserver. `tailwindcss-animate` is already installed.
- **No i18n.** English-only presentation. No Paraglide integration needed.
- **No backend.** Purely static frontend content sourced from existing documentation.
- **No auth.** Public page, accessible without login.
- **TanStack Start routing conventions.** Layout route at `talks.tsx`, page route at `talks/claude-code.tsx`.
- **Existing component patterns.** Section components follow the `components/landing/` pattern. Reuse `@repo/ui` primitives.
- **Accessibility.** Keyboard navigation must work. All interactive elements reachable via Tab. Reduced motion respected. Section dots have `aria-label` attributes.
- **Respect theme toggle.** Page works in both light and dark mode. No forced dark override.

---

## Non-goals

- **Slide-deck export** (PDF, PPTX). Out of scope.
- **Print support.** Web-only presentation. No print stylesheet.
- **Speaker notes.** Not needed — the presenter knows the content.
- **Real-time collaboration.** No multiplayer/sync features.
- **CMS-backed content.** Content is hardcoded in components. Editing requires a code change.
- **Animation library** (Framer Motion, GSAP). Pure CSS is sufficient.
- **i18n / translations.** English-only.

---

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Route structure: layout route + page route

Following the `demo.tsx` pattern, a layout route at `talks.tsx` wraps all talk pages. The layout handles full-screen chrome (no Header). Individual talks are child routes.

```
src/routes/
├── talks.tsx                      # Layout route: Outlet, no Header
└── talks/
    └── claude-code.tsx            # Page: composes sections
```

**`talks.tsx`** — minimal layout:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, Outlet } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/talks')({
  component: TalksLayout,
})

function TalksLayout() {
  return <Outlet />
}
```

**`__root.tsx`** — extend AppShell to hide Header for talks:

```tsx
const isTalksPage = pathname.startsWith('/talks')
// Add to existing condition:
{!isDocsPage && !isTalksPage && <Header />}
```

### 2. Component architecture: `components/presentation/`

Follows the `components/landing/` pattern. 7 section components + 4 shared primitives.

```
src/components/presentation/
├── IntroSection.tsx                # Section 1: What is Claude Code
├── SetupSection.tsx                # Section 2: Prerequisites & setup
├── BuildingBlocksSection.tsx       # Section 3: CLAUDE.md, Skills, Hooks, Agents
├── DevProcessSection.tsx           # Section 4: Tiers S / F-lite / F-full
├── AgentTeamsSection.tsx           # Section 5: 9 agents, routing tree
├── TestReviewSection.tsx           # Section 6: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR, review flow
├── EndToEndSection.tsx             # Section 7: /bootstrap → /scaffold → /review → /pr
├── PresentationNav.tsx             # Side dots + keyboard nav
├── CodeBlock.tsx                   # Styled code with optional typing animation
├── StatCounter.tsx                 # Animated number counter
└── SectionContainer.tsx            # Full-viewport section wrapper
```

### 3. Scroll-snap sections with `SectionContainer`

Each section is wrapped in `SectionContainer` which provides:
- `min-h-dvh` for full-viewport height (with `min-h-screen` fallback)
- `scroll-snap-align: start` for snap behavior
- A unique `id` for anchor navigation from `PresentationNav`
- Flex layout for vertical centering of content

The parent scroll container on the page uses `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory`.

```tsx
type SectionContainerProps = {
  id: string
  children: React.ReactNode
  className?: string
}

function SectionContainer({ id, children, className }: SectionContainerProps) {
  return (
    <section
      id={id}
      className={cn(
        'min-h-dvh snap-start flex flex-col justify-center px-6 py-16 lg:px-16',
        className
      )}
    >
      {children}
    </section>
  )
}
```

### 4. Animation approach: pure CSS + IntersectionObserver

| Animation | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Scroll-triggered reveals** | Extend existing `AnimatedSection` pattern. IntersectionObserver toggles CSS class. Direction variants via props (`fade-up`, `fade-left`, `scale-in`). Stagger children with Tailwind `delay-100`, `delay-200`, etc. |
| **Code block typing** | CSS `@keyframes typing` with `steps()` function. `width: 0` → `width: 100%` with `overflow: hidden`, `white-space: nowrap`, and a blinking cursor via `border-right`. Triggered by IntersectionObserver. |
| **Stat counters** | `StatCounter` component: `useEffect` + `requestAnimationFrame` loop counting from 0 to target. Triggered by IntersectionObserver. Duration ~1.5s with ease-out. |
| **Pipeline flow** | Sequential reveal of pipeline steps using staggered `delay-*` classes. Each step fades in left-to-right with the connecting line growing between them. |
| **Reduced motion** | All animations check `window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')`. If true, content renders immediately. Follow existing pattern from `AnimatedSection.tsx`. |

### 5. PresentationNav: dots + keyboard

A fixed-position component on the right edge showing 7 dots (one per section). Uses IntersectionObserver to track the currently visible section and highlight the corresponding dot.

Keyboard event listener on the page container captures arrow keys, Page Up/Down, Home/End, number keys, and Escape. Scrolls to the target section via `element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })`.

```tsx
type PresentationNavProps = {
  sections: ReadonlyArray<{ id: string; label: string }>
}
```

Each dot has:
- `aria-label` with the section name
- `role="link"` (since clicking scrolls to a section)
- Visual highlight (filled vs outlined) for the active section
- Tooltip on hover showing the section label

### 6. Theme: respect user preference

The page uses standard `bg-background text-foreground` and works in both light and dark mode. No forced dark override. The design uses semantic Tailwind classes (`bg-muted`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`, etc.) that adapt to the active theme automatically.

For visual impact, the page uses subtle background gradients and glow effects that are tuned for both modes:
- **Dark mode:** `bg-primary/15` glows, `bg-muted/30` code blocks
- **Light mode:** `bg-primary/5` glows, `bg-muted/50` code blocks

```tsx
function ClaudeCodePresentation() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-background text-foreground ...">
      {/* Inherits user's light/dark preference */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 7. CodeBlock component

A styled `<pre><code>` block with:
- Monospace font (`font-mono`)
- Subtle background (`bg-muted/30` in dark mode, `bg-muted/50` in light mode)
- Rounded corners and subtle border
- Optional `typing` prop that enables the typing animation
- Optional `language` prop for basic syntax coloring via CSS classes (no shiki — too heavy for a presentation page)
- Line numbers via CSS counter

No shiki dependency. Syntax highlighting is handled with a lightweight approach: hardcoded CSS classes for keywords, strings, comments, and punctuation. This is sufficient for the short code snippets in a presentation context.

## Section Content Specification

### Section 1: IntroSection

**Layout:** Centered, hero-style.

**Content:**
- Badge: "Introducing Claude Code"
- Title: "Your AI Development Team" (large, `text-5xl lg:text-6xl`)

alias cc-front='claude --agent frontend-dev'
alias cc-back='claude --agent backend-dev'
alias cc-test='claude --agent tester'
alias cc-pa='claude --agent product-lead'
```

### Section 3: BuildingBlocksSection

**Layout:** Four quadrants (2x2 grid on desktop, stacked on mobile).

**Content — each quadrant is a card:**

1. **CLAUDE.md** — "The constitution"
   - Icon: `FileText` from lucide
   - Description: "Project-level instructions. Critical rules, coding standards, skill registry, agent definitions."
   - Mini code block: 4-5 lines from the CLAUDE.md TL;DR section

2. **17 Skills** — "Slash commands"
   - Icon: `Zap`
   - Description: "Reusable workflows: /commit, /review, /bootstrap, /scaffold, /pr, /promote..."
   - Visual: pills/badges showing skill names

3. **Hooks** — "Auto-enforcement"
   - Icon: `Shield`
   - Description: "Biome auto-format on save, security warnings, git pre-commit/push quality gates."
   - Mini list: 3 hook types

4. **9 Agent Definitions** — ".claude/agents/"
   - Icon: `Users`
   - Description: "Role-specific .md files defining tools, permissions, domains, and skills."
   - Visual: file tree snippet of `.claude/agents/`

### Section 4: DevProcessSection

**Layout:** Title at top, then a styled decision flowchart, then stat cards below.

**Content:**
- Title: "Development Process by Tiers"
- Subtitle: "Match process to complexity. File count alone does not determine tier."

- **Flowchart** (styled text, not an image):

```
Is it ≤3 files with no arch risk?
├── Yes → Tier S: Worktree + PR
└── No
    ├── Clear scope, single domain? → Tier F-lite: Worktree + agents + /review
    └── New arch, unclear requirements? → Tier F-full: Bootstrap + worktree + agents + /review
```

- **Key insight callout:** "A 50-file mechanical change may be F-lite. A 3-file rate limiter may be F-full."

- **Stat cards row:**
  - 624 commits / 808 sessions
  - 12,110 Bash tool calls
  - 3,647 Edit tool calls
  - 6,572 messages exchanged

### Section 5: AgentTeamsSection

**Layout:** Title, then 3 category rows, then routing tree.

**Content:**
- Title: "Agent Teams"
- Subtitle: "9 agents in 3 categories. Coordinate via shared task lists and messaging."

- **3 category cards** (horizontal on desktop, stacked on mobile):

  1. **Domain Agents** (code writers) — border color: varied per agent
     - frontend-dev (cyan): `apps/web/`, `packages/ui/`
     - backend-dev (green): `apps/api/`, `packages/types/`
     - devops (yellow): `packages/config/`, root configs

  2. **Quality Agents** (verification)
     - tester (blue): Test generation &amp; coverage
     - fixer (magenta): Fix accepted review comments
     - security-auditor (red): Vulnerability detection

  3. **Strategy Agents** (planning)
     - architect (white): System design, tier classification
     - product-lead (purple): Requirements, triage, specs
     - doc-writer (gray): Documentation maintenance

- **Coordination primitives** listed below the cards:
  - TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TaskList — shared task list
  - SendMessage — direct messaging between agents
  - blockedBy — task dependencies
  - Fresh reviewer pattern — no agent reviews code it wrote

### Section 6: TestReviewSection

**Layout:** Two halves — left shows RED-GREEN-REFACTOR, right shows the review pipeline.

**Content — left half:** "Test-First"
- RED: Tester writes failing tests from spec
- GREEN: Domain agents implement to pass tests
- REFACTOR: Clean up while keeping tests green
- Visual: 3 colored blocks (red → green → blue) with arrows

**Content — right half:** "Review Pipeline"
- Step 1: `/review` spawns fresh agents (never the authors)
- Step 2: Each produces Conventional Comments
- Step 3: `/1b1` walks human through findings (accept/reject/defer)
- Step 4: Parallel fixers apply accepted fixes by domain
- Visual: pipeline flow diagram

**Callout quote:** "Human decides, Claude orchestrates, agents specialize."

### Section 7: EndToEndSection

**Layout:** Centered pipeline flow with animated steps.

**Content:**
- Title: "End-to-End: Idea to Production"
- Subtitle: "A real feature in 5 commands."

- **Animated pipeline** (sequential reveal, left-to-right):

```
/bootstrap          /scaffold          /review          /pr          /promote
Idea → Spec    →   Spec → Code    →  Fresh review  →  Pull      →  Staging
                                      + /1b1           Request       → Main
```

Each step is a card with:
  - Command name (large, monospace)
  - Arrow/line connecting to the next step
  - 1-line description below

- **Final stats callout:**
  - "808 sessions. 680 hours of compute. 624 commits. 88% task completion."
  - "19 PR review fixes across 4 parallel agents touching 30 files — in a single session."

- **Closing:** Small "Built with Roxabi" text and link back to home.

### No new dependencies

All functionality uses:
- Existing `@repo/ui` (Card, Badge, Button, cn)
- Existing `lucide-react` icons
- Existing `tailwindcss-animate` classes
- CSS `@keyframes` for typing animation
- CSS `scroll-snap-type` / `scroll-snap-align`
- `IntersectionObserver` API
- `requestAnimationFrame` for stat counters

## Resolved Decisions

| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Route namespace | `/talks/claude-code` | Namespaced for future talks. Short, semantic, SEO-friendly. Architect recommended. |
| Layout approach | Extend AppShell check in `__root.tsx` | Simplest option — follows existing `/docs` pattern. Architect recommended. |
| Component location | `components/presentation/` | Follows `components/landing/` pattern. Sections are substantial standalone components. Architect recommended. |
| Animation library | None (pure CSS) | Zero new deps. `tailwindcss-animate` already installed. Existing patterns sufficient. Architect recommended. |
| Syntax highlighting | CSS classes (no shiki) | Shiki is too heavy for short presentation snippets. Manual class-based coloring is sufficient. |
| Dark mode | Respect user's toggle | User decision — page works in both light and dark mode. No forced override. |
| Scroll behavior | `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory` | Native, smooth, no JS library. Disable on mobile for better UX. |
| Mobile scroll-snap | Disabled (&lt;768px) | Small screens need natural scrolling. Snap can feel jarring on touch. |
| i18n | None | English-only presentation. No Paraglide overhead. |
