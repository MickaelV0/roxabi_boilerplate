description: Project vision, roadmap and technical decisions for Roxabi Boilerplate
---

## 1. Purpose

### Why

Skip infrastructure setup. Focus directly on business features.

> *"The house foundations. Build whatever you want on top."*

### For Whom

- Solo developers
- Small teams (2-3 devs)
- Early-stage startups

### Target Products

- **B2B**: Internal tools, dashboards, admin panels
- **B2C**: Basic user-facing apps
- **Long-term focus**: Built for scalability, not throwaway MVPs

### Non-Goals

- Not a CMS
- Not an e-commerce platform
- Not for mobile native apps
- Not a marketplace builder

### Success Criteria

> *"When I build my first business feature, it just works."*

- Auth, billing, multi-tenant: ready out of the box
- Developer experience: smooth, no friction
- Code patterns: clear, consistent, scalable

**Measurable:**
- **Time to first feature**: Minimal time to add a business feature
- **Zero config**: Clone → dev in less than 5 minutes
- **Production-ready**: Deployable to prod without modifications

---

## 2. Principles

### North Stars

1. **Simplicity first** - Fewer features but they work perfectly
2. **Scalability** - Built to grow, not to throw away
3. **Convention over configuration** - Strong opinions, fewer decisions to make

### Trade-offs

| Choice | Preference |
|--------|------------|
| Simple vs Flexible | **Flexible** (modular architecture with opinionated defaults but extensible) |
| Convention vs Freedom | **Explicit opt-out** (possible to deviate but must be justified/documented) |
| Technical debt | **Zero tolerance** (we don't ship "temporary" code) |

### Non-Negotiables

- TypeScript strict mode everywhere
- TDD: tests written before code
- All quality gates must pass before merge
- Documentation maintained like code

---

## 3. AI Team & Skills

### Two Categories of AI Agents

The boilerplate distinguishes between two types of AI agents:

**Development Agents** - Assist in building the SaaS
| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| Dev | Feature implementation |
| Review | Code review, quality |
| Test | Writing and maintaining tests |
| Deploy | CI/CD, deployments |
| Product | Specs, product ownership |
| Ops/Infra | Monitoring, infrastructure |
| Frontend | UI/UX specialist |
| Backend | API/DB specialist |

**Runtime Agents** - Interact with the deployed SaaS
| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| Domain agents | Business-specific automation |
| User personas | Test user flows and UX |
| Integration agents | Connect with external services |

### CLI for AI Interaction

A CLI generated from OpenAPI specs enables AI agents to interact with the SaaS API:
- **Universal access**: Any AI capable of running bash can use it
- **Human-friendly**: Developers can also use it for testing and debugging
- **Auto-generated**: Stays in sync with API changes

### Skills Organization

| Source | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| Built-in | Skills included in the boilerplate |
| Marketplace | Centralized registry with review/quality |
| Git-based | Exceptional import from Git repos |

### Orchestration

- **Workflow-driven**: Predefined workflows chain agents
- **Event-driven**: Agents react to events (hooks, PR, etc.)
- **Autonomy**: Autonomous agents, human review afterwards

---

## 4. Developer Experience

### Code Methodology

- **Strict TDD**: Tests written before code, always
- Functional patterns where appropriate
- Named exports over default exports
- No circular dependencies

### Quality Gates (All Required for Merge)

- [ ] Lint clean (Biome)
- [ ] TypeScript error-free
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Minimum coverage threshold met
- [ ] Review approved (human or AI)

### Documentation Strategy

| Aspect | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| Format | Docs-as-code (Markdown in repo) |
| API | Swagger/OpenAPI auto-generated |
| Ownership | Dedicated AI agent generates, human reviews |
| Versioning | Documented with code |

### Testing Philosophy

- **Unit/Integration**: Vitest
- **E2E**: Playwright
- **Coverage**: Minimum threshold enforced
- **TDD**: Test first, implementation second

## 5. Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

```
roxabi_boilerplate/
├── .env                    # Global environment variables
├── apps/
│   ├── web/               # Frontend (TanStack Start)
│   ├── api/               # Backend (NestJS + Fastify)
│   └── packages/          # Shared code
│       ├── ui/            # Shared UI (Shadcn/UI)
│       ├── config/        # Shared configurations
│       └── types/         # Shared TypeScript types
├── docs/                   # Documentation (Docker-based server)
└── .claude/                # Claude Code configuration
```

### Multi-Tenant Model

```
META Organization (super admin)
└── Organization
    └── Child Organization(s)
        └── Users
```

**Strategy**: Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Single database
- Isolation by `tenant_id` + PostgreSQL RLS
- Performant, simple to maintain

### API Design

- **Style**: REST
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger auto-generated
- **Contracts**: Shared types via `@repo/types`
- **CLI**: Auto-generated from OpenAPI spec for human and AI interaction

### Data Flow

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │────▶│   Web App   │────▶│   API       │
│   Browser   │◀────│ (TanStack)  │◀────│  (NestJS)   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                           │                   │
                           ▼                   ▼
                    ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
                    │    apps/    │     │  PostgreSQL │
                    │  packages/  │     │   (RLS)     │
                    └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

## 6. Workflows

### Branching Strategy

**GitHub Flow**
- `main` = production-ready
- Feature branches for each change
- PR required for merge

### Development Workflow

```
Idea → GitHub Issue → Branch → Dev → PR → Review → Merge → Deploy → Close
```

### Automations (Hooks)

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Pre-push | Tests run |
| PR opened | Full CI (lint, types, tests, coverage) |
| Post-merge | Auto deploy + notifications |

### Deployment Strategy

**Continuous Deployment**
- Merge to main = automatic deploy to production
- Feature flags for progressive rollouts (via PostHog)

### Hotfix Process

- Direct commit to `main` with post-deploy validation
- Automatic rollback if health checks fail

---

## 7. Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP

**Scope**
- [ ] Auth + Users (Better Auth)
- [ ] Multi-tenant (RLS)
- [ ] RBAC (roles and permissions)
- [ ] Admin panel
- [ ] i18n (internationalization)
- [ ] Audit logs
- [ ] Notifications (emails + in-app)

**Success Criteria**
- Clone → dev in less than 5 min
- First business feature added quickly
- Deployable to production without modifications

### Phase 2+: Backlog

To be prioritized later:
- [ ] CLI generated from OpenAPI (AI-ready)
- [ ] Billing (Stripe/Paddle/Lemon Squeezy via abstraction)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Webhooks
- [ ] Public API
- [ ] Additional OAuth providers
- [ ] Plugins/extensions system
- [ ] Themes
- [ ] Marketplace
