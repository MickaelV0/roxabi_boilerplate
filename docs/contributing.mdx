## Branching Strategy

We use **GitHub Flow** - a simple, trunk-based workflow optimized for continuous delivery.

### Main Branch

- `main` is always production-ready
- All changes go through Pull Requests
- Protected with required reviews and status checks

### Branch Naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Feature | `feat/<issue-id>-<slug>` | `feat/42-user-auth` |
| Bug fix | `fix/<issue-id>-<slug>` | `fix/15-login-timeout` |
| Hotfix | `hotfix/<issue-id>-<slug>` | `hotfix/99-security-patch` |
| Docs | `docs/<slug>` | `docs/api-reference` |

### Workflow

```
1. Pick a GitHub Issue
2. Create feature branch from main
3. Implement changes (with tests)
4. Open Pull Request
5. Pass all quality gates
6. Get review approval
7. Merge to main
8. Auto-deploy to production
```

---

## Commit Conventions

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear, automated changelogs.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type | Description | Version Bump |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `feat` | New feature | MINOR |
| `fix` | Bug fix | PATCH |
| `docs` | Documentation only | None |
| `style` | Formatting, no code change | None |
| `refactor` | Code change, no new feature or fix | None |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests | None |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | None |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | None |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | PATCH |

### Scope

Use the package name for monorepo changes:

- `feat(web):` - Frontend changes
- `fix(api):` - Backend changes
- `docs(ui):` - UI package documentation
- `chore(config):` - Config package maintenance

### Breaking Changes

Add `!` after the type or include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:

```
feat(api)!: redesign authentication endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: /auth/login now requires email instead of username
```

### Examples

```
feat(web): add user authentication flow
fix(api): resolve database connection timeout
docs: update README with installation steps
test(ui): add Button component tests
chore: update dependencies
ci: add coverage reporting to pipeline
```

## Pull Requests

### Before Opening a PR

- [ ] Branch is up-to-date with `main`
- [ ] All tests pass locally (`bun test`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`bun lint`)
- [ ] Types check (`bun typecheck`)
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventions

### PR Title

Use Conventional Commits format for the PR title (used for squash merge):

```
feat(web): add user dashboard
fix(api): resolve timeout on large queries
```

### PR Description

Include:
- Summary of changes
- Link to related issue
- Testing performed
- Screenshots (for UI changes)

---

## Quality Gates

All PRs must pass before merge:

| Gate | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Lint | `bun lint` | Biome linting |
| Types | `bun typecheck` | TypeScript strict mode |
| Tests | `bun test` | All tests pass |
| Coverage | - | Minimum threshold met |
| Review | - | At least 1 approval |

### After Merge

When a PR is merged to `main`, deployment happens automatically:

1. **Web** (TanStack Start) — Vercel detects the push and deploys
2. **API** (NestJS) — Vercel detects the push and deploys (zero-config NestJS support)
3. GitHub Actions runs CI and reports status on the commit

If something breaks, roll back via the Vercel dashboard (Deployments &gt; Promote previous). See the [Deployment Guide](/docs/guides/deployment) for details.

## Branch Protection

The `main` branch is protected with:

- Required pull request reviews (1 minimum)
- Required status checks (CI must pass)
- Dismiss stale approvals on new commits
- Require conversation resolution
- No direct pushes

---

## Labels

### Priority

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `P0` | Urgent — blocking or critical, do immediately |
| `P1` | High — important for current milestone |
| `P2` | Medium — should be done soon |
| `P3` | Low — nice to have, backlog |

### Size

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `XS` | Trivial change (&lt;1 hour) |
| `S` | Small change (few hours) |
| `M` | Medium change (1-2 days) |
| `L` | Large change (3-5 days) |
| `XL` | Epic (needs breakdown) |

### Type

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `feature` | New functionality |
| `bug` | Something broken |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `dx` | Developer experience |
| `ai` | AI/Agent related |
| `workflow` | Process improvement |
| `setup` | Infrastructure setup |

---

## Issue Templates

When creating issues, use the provided templates:

- **Bug Report**: For reporting bugs with reproduction steps
- **Feature Request**: For proposing new features

---

## Documentation (MDX)

Documentation uses Fumadocs with MDX format. All docs live in the `docs/` folder.

### Creating Documentation Files

Files must be `.mdx` with frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: Page Title
description: Brief description for SEO and previews
---

Content here...
```

### Folder Structure

```
docs/
├── index.mdx           # Home page
├── getting-started.mdx # Main docs
├── meta.json           # Navigation order
├── architecture/       # Architecture documentation
│   ├── meta.json
│   ├── index.mdx
│   └── *.mdx
├── processes/          # Development processes
│   ├── meta.json
│   ├── index.mdx
│   └── *.mdx
├── standards/          # Coding standards & best practices
│   ├── meta.json
│   └── *.mdx
├── analyses/           # Pre-spec analyses
│   ├── meta.json
│   └── *.mdx
└── specs/              # Feature specifications
    ├── meta.json
    └── *.mdx
```

### Adding New Pages

1. Create `.mdx` file with frontmatter
2. Add filename (without extension) to `meta.json` in the `pages` array
3. Run `bun docs` to preview

### Special Characters in MDX

Escape `<` as `&lt;` to avoid JSX parsing errors (e.g., `&lt;50KB` instead of `<50KB`).
