title: Persona & GTM Brief
description: Primary customer persona, needs, buying behavior, and go-to-market strategy for Roxabi Boilerplate
---

## Primary Persona: "The Impatient Architect"

**Who:** Senior dev / ex-CTO (5–10 yrs exp) building their first or second SaaS on the side,
or recently quit their job to go indie. Building B2B SaaS — internal tools, dashboards,
productivity apps. Already using Claude Code or Cursor daily.

**Mindset:** *"I know how to build this. I just don't want to spend 6 weeks building what
doesn't matter. I want to prove the idea works first."*

**Day-to-day pain:** Every new project restarts with the same week of hell — auth, multi-tenant
schema, RBAC, deployment, CI/CD, linting config, DB setup. Then when they finally start building
the actual product, motivation is half-gone and they're already behind.

---

## What They Want

| Priority | Need | Why it matters |
|----------|------|----------------|
| 1 | **Zero-to-dev in <5 min** | They've set up 10 projects — setup friction = rage |
| 2 | **Auth + multi-tenancy + RBAC out of the box** | B2B SaaS requires this, it's hard to retrofit |
| 3 | **Code they can read and own** | Fear of black-box abstractions they'll fight at 2am |
| 4 | **Modern, scalable stack** | They'll be living in this codebase for years |
| 5 | **AI-ready out of the box** | They already use Claude Code — want it to "just work" |
| 6 | **Active maintenance + docs** | Biggest fear: abandoned boilerplate = tech debt |

---

## What They Buy

A **one-time license** ($199–$349 sweet spot) after:

1. Seeing the **creator's credibility** (track record, build-in-public, responsiveness)
2. Recognizing their **exact stack** (if it's Next.js and they want TanStack, they bounce)
3. Validating **active maintenance** (recent commits, Discord activity, changelog)
4. A specific feature clicks (e.g., "this has multi-tenancy with RLS, the others don't")

They do **not** buy on feature lists. They buy on **trust + time savings realized**.

## How to Sell Roxabi

### Positioning

Roxabi's genuine moat: the only boilerplate with a **pre-built 10-agent AI development team
+ structured workflow (frame → spec → plan → implement → review)**. This directly solves the
#1 AI pain: fresh projects have no context → Claude hallucinates and produces inconsistent code.
Roxabi ships fully wired for Claude Code from day one.

> **Positioning line:** *"The boilerplate Claude Code was built to work on."*

Not "AI-native" (that's noise). Instead: **show** it. A 2-min video of Claude Code running
`/dev #1` on a fresh Roxabi clone, autonomously delivering a feature, is worth more than any
marketing copy.

### Channel Priority

| Channel | Tactic |
|---------|--------|
| **Twitter/X** | Build in public 3–5×/week. Show agent team in action. Real outputs, real commits. |
| **Newsletters** | Indie Hackers, React/TS ecosystem newsletters. One sponsored issue = 200+ leads. |
| **HN Show HN** | Once ready. Suggested title: *"Show HN: SaaS boilerplate where Claude Code does 90% of the dev work"* |
| **Word-of-mouth** | First 50 customers are the sales team. Discord + responsive creator presence. |

### Pricing

**$299 one-time.** Never $49 (screams low quality). One update tier max — no subscription.

Higher price = higher perceived quality. Supastarter's creator confirmed: conversion improved
at every price increase from $49 → $149 → $299 → $349.

## Design Expectations

| Signal | What they expect |
|--------|-----------------|
| UI library | **shadcn/ui** — non-negotiable for credibility in 2026 |
| Color scheme | Neutral grays + 1–2 strategic accents. No rainbow dashboards. |
| Dark mode | Default, not optional |
| Typography | Inter/Geist, 70–80 char lines, clear hierarchy |
| Feel | Professional, not AI-generated — consistent spacing (8px grid), design tokens, accessible |
| Anti-patterns | Heavy rounded corners + neon = instant trust loss |

The design must feel like **Stripe's dashboard had a baby with Linear** — minimal,
data-focused, zero clutter.

---

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor gap | Roxabi answer |
|----------------|--------------|
| Next.js lock-in (ShipFast, Makerkit) | TanStack Start + NestJS — unique, performant, future-proof |
| No AI workflow | 10-agent team + CLAUDE.md + skills + `/dev` orchestrator |
| Abandonment fear | Roxabi is the product the creator builds ON — extreme dogfooding |
| Abstraction hell | Minimal abstractions, eject-friendly, code you can read |
| Fresh project = AI chaos | Ships with full context system — Claude works immediately |
| Multi-tenancy is optional/add-on | RLS multi-tenancy is core, day one |

## One-Line Pitch

> *"Clone → Claude → ship. The only boilerplate where your AI team is already hired."*
