## Executive Summary

Over **16 days** (2026-01-23 to 2026-02-07), Roxabi's development workflow ran **808 Claude Code sessions** totaling **680 hours of compute time** and producing **624 commits**. Claude Code operates as a **parallelized development workforce** — not a simple code assistant — handling spec interviews, multi-agent PR reviews, feature implementations, knowledge management, and git orchestration across multiple repositories simultaneously.

**Overall satisfaction: 88%** (220/254 sessions rated satisfied or likely satisfied).

## What Works Well

### 1. Multi-Agent Parallel Code Reviews & Fixes

Dispatching multi-agent reviews on large PRs, interactively triaging findings, then executing fixes across dozens of files in parallel. Standout: **19 PR review fixes across 4 parallel agents touching 30 files** in a single session.

### 2. Full-Stack Feature Delivery Pipelines

Entire features driven from spec to ship within single sessions — spec interviews, implementation plans, frontend + backend code, checks, commit/push/merge. Examples: UI component library migration (24 files), Fumadocs v16 integration.

### 3. Knowledge Base Automation via Telegram

2ndBrain system where links are sent through Telegram and Claude auto-fetches, summarizes, categorizes, and saves them with structured metadata. **15+ links processed in a single session** with custom bot commands.

## Friction Analysis

### Category 1: Wrong Approach Leading to Wasted Cycles

**27 instances** of Claude committing deeply to an incorrect strategy before surfacing it.

| Example | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Re-implemented Fumadocs from scratch on an old branch before discovering main already had it via squash merge | Full branch reset and redo |
| Removed wrong animation (cell hover instead of proximity glow), then searched unrelated files | Never reached a fix |

**Mitigation**: Provide upfront constraints. Ask Claude to outline its approach before executing on complex tasks.

### Category 2: CSS/UI Debugging Failures

Claude struggles with visual styling, cycling through approaches that don't work.

| Example | Duration | Result |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Dropdown menu white border (CSS variable restores, fumadocs CSS swaps, data-highlighted migrations) | **724 min** | No resolution — all changes rolled back |
| Dropdown hover/focus styling (data-highlighted, focus-visible, Tailwind source scanning) | Multiple sessions | Rolled back entirely |

**Mitigation**: Set a 2-attempt limit on CSS fix approaches before switching to inline-style isolation debugging.

### Category 3: Misunderstanding Specific Intent

**14 instances** of Claude misinterpreting which file, which person, or which interaction.

| Example | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| Transaction matching: showed samples from wrong file, applied wrong criteria | Multiple corrections needed |
| Financial dashboard: added "soulte" when "frais de partage" was meant, used wrong DMTO rates | Had to correct with notary PDF figures |

**Mitigation**: Reference specific file paths, variable names, and selectors in initial prompts to short-circuit correction loops.

## Suggestions & Actions

### CLAUDE.md Additions

| # | Addition | Section | Why |
|---|---------|---------|-----|
| 1 | CSS: try inline style debugging first, max 2 CSS-only guesses before isolating | `## Debugging` | Multiple 700+ min sessions with no CSS fix resolution |
| 2 | Always check branch merge status before deletion: `git log --oneline main..&lt;branch>` | `## Git Operations` | Unmerged branches deleted, squash-merge work redone |
| 3 | Bias toward action over investigation for fix requests | `## General Guidelines` | Too much exploration instead of attempting fixes |
| 4 | Before rebasing, check if main already contains changes via squash merge | `## Git Operations` | Full branch redo after discovering squash merge |
| 5 | Only change what user explicitly asked for (don't modify JS when asked to change HTML) | `## General Guidelines` | User interruptions from Claude modifying wrong layer |
| 6 | When pre-push hooks fail on unrelated type errors, inform user before using --no-verify | `## Git Operations` | Silent force pushes bypassing quality checks |

### Skills to Create

| Skill | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `/cleanup` | Safe git branch/worktree management with merge-status verification | **Done** ✅ |
| `/review-fix` | Autonomous PR review + parallel fix pipeline | Planned |
| `/bootstrap` | Feature scaffolding from idea to draft PR | Planned |
| `/save` | Standardized 2ndBrain link processing with metadata template | Planned |

### Hooks to Add

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| UI package rebuild | `Edit` on `**/packages/ui/**` | Prevent broken exports after component changes |
| Git pre-delete check | Before `git branch -D` | Verify merge status before destructive operations |

## On the Horizon

### 1. Autonomous Multi-Agent PR Review and Fix Pipeline

**Current workflow** (manual orchestration):
```
You → "review PR" → Claude reviews → You triage → You dispatch fix agents → You verify
```

**Target workflow** (single prompt):
```
You → "review & fix PR #123" → Done
```

**How it works**:
1. **Coordinator agent** reads every changed file, produces categorized issue list (bugs, style, architecture, missing tests) with severity ratings
2. **Spawns parallel fix agents** — one per category, each on the current branch
3. Each fix agent **runs typecheck + tests** after changes, reverts if broken
4. Coordinator **runs full pre-push hook suite**
5. Produces summary + conventional commit — no questions asked

**Why it matters**: Reduces the 27 "wrong approach" friction events by having agents validate against each other before presenting results. Eliminates the manual triage step.

**Implementation**: Package as a `/review-fix` skill that orchestrates the full chain using `Task` tool sub-agents, each in isolated contexts.

### 2. Autonomous Knowledge Ingestion and Project Scaffolding

**Current workflow** (multi-session):
```
Save links → Create issue → Write spec → Create branch/worktree → Implement
```

**Target workflow** (single prompt):
```
You → "Bootstrap feature: [description]" → Draft PR ready
```

**How it works**:
1. **Reads project conventions** — CLAUDE.md, skills, standards, existing patterns
2. **Searches codebase** for the most similar existing feature as reference
3. **Creates GitHub issue** with spec body and acceptance criteria via `gh issue create`
4. **Creates branch + worktree** following naming convention (`feat/XXX-slug`)
5. **Implements feature** following patterns found in step 2 — types, API routes, UI components
6. **Runs typecheck + build** to verify
7. **Commits, pushes, creates draft PR** via `gh pr create --draft`

**Why it matters**: Collapses the repetitive scaffolding steps (issue, branch, boilerplate, PR) into one shot. You review the draft PR instead of orchestrating the setup.

**Implementation**: Package as a `/bootstrap` skill that encodes project conventions and the full issue-to-PR pipeline.

### 3. Self-Healing CSS Iteration Loop (Future)

**Concept**: Combine Claude Code with Playwright screenshot capture in a loop — apply change, screenshot, evaluate against target, retry with different approach automatically. Eliminates the CSS debugging death spiral.

**Requires**: Headless browser integration (Playwright/Puppeteer) in the dev environment.

## Copyable Prompts

### CSS Debugging (Use When Facing UI Issues)

```
Fix this CSS issue. IMPORTANT: If your first fix doesn't work, immediately
switch to inline style debugging to isolate which element and property causes
the problem. Do NOT try more than 2 CSS-only guesses before isolating.
```

### Git Cleanup (Use Before Branch Deletion)

```
Before doing any git cleanup: 1) Show me `git branch -vv` with merge status
for each branch, 2) Show `git log --oneline main..<branch>` for any branch
you want to delete, 3) Wait for my explicit approval before deleting anything.
Never assume a branch is merged.
```

### Knowledge Saving (Batch Processing)

```
Process these links for my 2ndBrain knowledge base. For each link:
1) Fetch and read the content, 2) Write a 2-3 sentence summary,
3) Assign category tags from existing taxonomy,
4) Save with structured metadata (title, url, summary, tags, date_saved).
Process all links in sequence without asking for confirmation between each one.
```

## Relation to Issue #12

This analysis directly informs **Issue #12 — Setup: Claude Code agents & skills**. The insights data provides empirical evidence for:

- **Which skills deliver the most value**: `/cleanup` (done), `/review-fix`, `/bootstrap`, `/save`
- **Which agent patterns work**: Multi-agent parallel execution is proven (19 fixes / 4 agents / 30 files)
- **Which friction points skills should address**: CSS debugging, git safety, intent misunderstanding
- **Priority ordering**: Git operations (#1 goal category at 37 sessions) should be prioritized over less-used workflows

The existing analysis for #12 recommended **Option C (Balanced Approach)** with phased skill/agent creation. This usage data **validates that approach** and refines the priority list based on actual friction and usage patterns.
