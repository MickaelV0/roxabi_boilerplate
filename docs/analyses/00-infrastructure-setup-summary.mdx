**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Project**: Roxabi Boilerplate - SaaS Framework with AI Team Integration
**Tech Stack**: Bun, TurboRepo, TypeScript, TanStack Start (frontend), NestJS + Fastify (backend)

---

## 1. Overview

This document consolidates the technical analysis of six foundational infrastructure issues (#8-#13) for the Roxabi Boilerplate project. Each issue was evaluated against the current state of the art (2025-2026), presenting three implementation options: MVP (fastest), Gold Standard (best quality), and Balanced (recommended).

The Roxabi Boilerplate aims to provide a production-ready SaaS foundation with integrated AI development capabilities. The analyses cover the complete developer workflow: from local development quality gates (git hooks, testing) through CI/CD automation, documentation practices, AI agent integration, and team collaboration conventions.

**Key Finding**: All six analyses converge on the "Balanced Approach" recommendation, validating a consistent philosophy: implement enough infrastructure to enforce quality and enable scale, without over-engineering for the current project stage. The recommended stack leverages modern tools (Lefthook, Vitest, Changesets, GitHub Actions) that are purpose-built for Bun/TurboRepo monorepos.

**Dependency Notes:**
- Issue #8 (CI/CD) is blocked by #9 (Testing) and #10 (Git Hooks) - CI needs tests to run and hooks define local quality gates
- Issue #11 (Documentation) is blocked by #13 (Workflow conventions) - docs structure follows workflow patterns
- Issue #12 (Claude Agents) is blocked by #11 (Documentation) - agents need documented processes to follow

## 3. Recommended Implementation Order

| Phase | Issue | Title | Justification |
|-------|-------|-------|---------------|
| **1** | #13 | Workflow & Branching | Foundation for all collaboration; enables consistent commits and PRs |
| **2** | #10 | Git Hooks | Local quality enforcement before any code leaves dev machine |
| **3** | #9 | Testing Infrastructure | Required for CI; establishes TDD practices early |
| **4** | #8 | CI/CD GitHub Actions | Depends on tests and hooks; automates quality gates |
| **5** | #11 | Documentation Structure | Formalizes decisions and processes from phases 1-4 |
| **6** | #12 | Claude Code Agents | Builds on documented workflows; highest abstraction layer |

**Rationale**: Start with conventions (how we work), then enforcement (hooks), then validation (tests + CI), then documentation (capture what we built), then AI augmentation (leverage patterns).

## 4. Summary Table

| Issue | Title | Recommended Option | Complexity | Key Tool/Approach |
|-------|-------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|

| #9 | Testing Infrastructure | **C: Balanced** | 3/5 | Vitest with `projects` config + Playwright + shared `vitest.shared.ts` |
| #10 | Git Hooks | **C: Simplified** | 2/5 | Lefthook (Go binary) with parallel pre-commit/pre-push |

## 5. Quick Wins (Immediate Actions)

These can be implemented in the first 1-2 days with minimal dependencies:

1. **Install Lefthook** (#10)
   ```bash
   bun add -D lefthook && bunx lefthook install
   ```
   - Add basic `lefthook.yml` with Biome pre-commit hook
   - Immediate enforcement of code formatting

2. **Create GitHub Templates** (#13)
   - Add YAML issue forms: `bug-report.yml`, `feature-request.yml`
   - Add PR template with checklist
   - Configure branch protection on `main`

3. **Create ADR Template** (#11)
   - Add `docs/decisions/000-template.md` using MADR format
   - Document first decision: tech stack choices

4. **Add Basic CI Workflow** (#8)
   - Single workflow with lint/typecheck/test/build
   - No TurboRepo caching initially (add in phase 2)

5. **Initialize Vitest** (#9)
   - Add root `vitest.config.ts` with projects configuration
   - Create one example test per app to validate setup

## 6. Key Themes Across All Analyses

### Common Patterns Observed

1. **Runtime-Agnostic Tooling**: Preference for Go/Rust-based tools (Lefthook, Biome) over Node.js-based alternatives for performance and cross-platform consistency.

2. **Parallel Execution**: All recommended options leverage parallel processing (Lefthook parallel hooks, GitHub Actions parallel jobs, Vitest parallel tests).

3. **Monorepo-Native Design**: Tools explicitly support TurboRepo patterns (Changesets for versioning, Vitest `projects` for testing, `--affected` filtering for CI).

4. **Progressive Enhancement**: All balanced options provide clear upgrade paths to gold-standard implementations without requiring rewrites.

5. **Docs-as-Code**: Documentation treated as first-class code with version control, CI validation, and automation.

### Shared Tooling Recommendations

| Category | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Package Manager | Bun | 2x faster installs, native TypeScript |
| Build Orchestration | TurboRepo | Caching, affected detection, parallel tasks |
| Linting/Formatting | Biome | Single tool, fastest execution |
| Testing | Vitest + Playwright | Vite-native, excellent DX |
| Git Hooks | Lefthook | Go binary, parallel, monorepo support |
| Release Management | Changesets | Built for monorepos, decoupled versioning |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Native integration, generous free tier |
| API Documentation | TypeDoc | TypeScript-native, Markdown output |

### Architectural Direction

The analyses point toward a **convention-over-configuration** philosophy:
- Standardized commit messages enable automation
- Consistent file structures enable AI assistance
- Shared configurations reduce duplication
- Clear workflows enable onboarding
