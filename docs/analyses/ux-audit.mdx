# Comprehensive UX Audit

## Context

This audit examines every user-facing screen, component, and flow in the Roxabi Boilerplate web application (`apps/web`). The goal is to identify UX strengths and weaknesses, benchmark against modern SaaS standards (Stripe, Linear, Vercel), and produce a prioritized list of actionable improvements. The audit was conducted by reading every route file, component, layout, and supporting module in the codebase.

## Application Map

### Routes and Pages

| Route | Page | Purpose | Auth Required |
|-------|------|---------|---------------|
| `/` | Landing Page | Marketing / product overview | No |
| `/login` | Login | Email/password, OAuth, magic link sign-in | No (redirects if authed) |
| `/register` | Register | Create account with email or OAuth | No (redirects if authed) |
| `/reset-password` | Reset Password | Request password reset email | No |
| `/reset-password/confirm` | Set New Password | Enter new password via token | No |
| `/magic-link-sent` | Magic Link Confirmation | Tells user to check email, with resend | No |
| `/verify-email` | Email Verification | Processes token from verification email | No |
| `/org/settings` | Organization Settings | Rename, slug, delete organization | Yes |
| `/org/members` | Organization Members | View members, invite, change roles, remove | Yes |
| `/design-system` | Design System | Interactive component playground + theme editor | No |
| `/demo` | Demo Index | Catalog of tech demos | No (feature-flagged) |
| `/demo/*` | Various Demos | Store, Query, Table, Forms, SSR, i18n | No (feature-flagged) |
| `/docs/*` | Documentation | Fumadocs-powered MDX documentation site | No |

### Shared Components

| Component | Used On | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `Header` | All pages (except docs) | Navigation, auth state, org switcher, theme/locale/GitHub |
| `Footer` | Landing page only | Copyright + GitHub link |
| `AuthLayout` | All auth pages | Centered card with branding |
| `UserMenu` | Header (when authenticated) | Avatar dropdown with org links, sign out |
| `OrgSwitcher` | Header (when authenticated) | Switch/create organizations |

## Detailed Screen Analysis

### 1. Landing Page (`/`)

**Purpose:** Marketing page that communicates the value proposition of Roxabi Boilerplate.

**Sections:** Hero > Features (8 cards) > AI Team > Developer Experience (4 cards) > Tech Stack > CTA > Footer

**Strengths:**
- Clear value proposition in the hero ("Skip the infrastructure. Ship your features.")
- Strong visual hierarchy with section headings and consistent card patterns
- Stats section effectively communicates the "5 min setup" promise
- Animated sections with `IntersectionObserver` provide scroll-reveal polish
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` media query -- good accessibility
- Fully internationalized (en/fr)
- Responsive grid layouts (1/2/4 columns)
- Background glow effects add visual depth without overwhelming content

**Issues:**

- **[CRITICAL] No dashboard or app experience post-login.** After a user logs in, they are redirected to `/` -- the same landing page. There is no dashboard, home screen, or authenticated experience. A logged-in user sees the exact same marketing page as a visitor, with the only difference being the header showing a user avatar instead of Sign In/Sign Up buttons. This is the single biggest UX gap in the entire application.

- **[IMPORTANT] Footer only appears on the landing page.** The `Footer` component is only rendered inside the landing page route. All other pages (auth, org, design system) have no footer. This creates an inconsistent experience -- users scrolling to the bottom of the org members page see just a hard edge.

- **[IMPORTANT] "Get Started" CTA links to `/docs`.** Both the hero CTA and the bottom CTA section link to `/docs`. For a boilerplate product, the primary CTA should arguably link to the GitHub repo or a quickstart guide, not the general docs index. The secondary button already links to GitHub, creating redundancy.

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] No social proof section.** Modern SaaS landing pages (Vercel, Linear) include testimonials, logos, or GitHub stars. The page jumps from features directly to tech stack.

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] Feature cards are not interactive.** The 8 feature cards have hover effects but are not clickable. They could link to relevant docs sections for users wanting to learn more.

### 2. Login Page (`/login`)

**Purpose:** Multi-method sign-in (email/password, OAuth, magic link).

**Strengths:**
- Clean `AuthLayout` with centered card, brand link to home
- Three sign-in methods well-organized with "Or" separator
- Loading states on all buttons (`Signing in...`)
- Error display with `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"` -- good accessibility
- "Remember me" checkbox
- "Forgot password?" link positioned inline with password label (standard pattern)
- OAuth buttons conditionally rendered based on enabled providers
- Form disables inputs while loading
- Redirects authenticated users away automatically
- Password toggle via `PasswordInput` component

**Issues:**

- **[IMPORTANT] Magic link section feels like an afterthought.** It appears below the OAuth section, creating a confusing visual hierarchy: email/password form > "Or" > OAuth buttons > magic link. The magic link should either be integrated into the primary form (e.g., as a tab between "Password" and "Magic Link") or given its own clearly delineated section with a heading.

- **[IMPORTANT] No input validation feedback before submission.** The email and password inputs only validate on form submit. There is no real-time validation (e.g., email format checking, minimum password length hint). Modern auth flows (Clerk, Auth0) provide inline feedback.

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] No loading spinner on the sign-in button.** The text changes from "Sign in" to "Signing in..." but there is no visual spinner/animation. Stripe and Linear use a spinner alongside the text change.

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] Generic error messages.** The error display shows the raw server error message. There is no differentiation between "invalid credentials", "account not verified", or "account locked" -- the user just sees whatever the API returns.

### 3. Register Page (`/register`)

**Purpose:** Create a new account with email or OAuth.

**Strengths:**
- Same clean `AuthLayout` pattern
- Password strength indicator via `showStrength` prop on `PasswordInput`
- Success message appears inline after registration ("Check your email to verify your account")
- OAuth registration shares the same patterns as login
- Redirects authenticated users away

**Issues:**

- **[IMPORTANT] No password confirmation field.** Users enter their password once with no confirmation. While the password toggle mitigates this somewhat, best practice (and user expectation) is a confirmation field, especially for new accounts.

- **[IMPORTANT] Post-registration flow is abrupt.** After successful registration, the page shows an inline message ("Check your email to verify your account") but the form remains visible with all fields filled. The user is left wondering what to do next. Better pattern: replace the form with a success state showing a mail icon, the email address, and a clear "check your inbox" message (similar to magic-link-sent page).

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] Name field has no guidance.** Is it full name? First name? Display name? A placeholder or helper text would clarify expectations.

### 4. Reset Password Flow (`/reset-password` + `/reset-password/confirm`)

**Purpose:** Two-step password reset (request link, set new password).

**Strengths:**
- Clean, minimal forms appropriate for the task
- Token validation handled gracefully -- missing/invalid tokens show clear error with link to request new reset
- Password strength indicator on the confirmation page
- Toast notifications for success states
- Clear "Back to sign in" navigation

**Issues:**

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] No rate limiting feedback on the request page.** Users can spam the "Send reset link" button. Unlike the magic link page, there is no cooldown timer. The server may rate-limit, but the client provides no feedback about this.

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] Success message and form remain on screen together.** After requesting a reset, the green success message appears but the form remains. Pattern from Stripe: replace the form with a success view.

### 5. Magic Link Sent Page (`/magic-link-sent`)

**Purpose:** Confirmation page after requesting a magic link, with resend capability.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent UX with 60-second cooldown timer on resend
- Dynamic button text showing countdown ("Resend in 42s")
- Personalized message with the email address when available
- Clear "Back to sign in" link

**Issues:**

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] No email provider deeplinks.** Modern magic link confirmations (Resend, Vercel) provide "Open Gmail" / "Open Outlook" buttons to reduce friction. This page forces users to manually navigate to their email.

### 6. Email Verification Page (`/verify-email`)

**Purpose:** Processes email verification token from the URL.

**Strengths:**
- Three-state display (loading/success/error) is well-structured
- Loading state uses a spinner animation
- Success state has a clear CTA ("Continue to app")
- Error state offers resend option when session email is available
- Missing token case is handled separately from verification failure

**Issues:**

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] "Continue to app" links to `/`.** Since there is no dashboard, the user is sent back to the landing page. This will feel anticlimactic after completing verification.

### 7. Organization Settings (`/org/settings`)

**Purpose:** View/edit organization name and slug, danger zone for deletion.

**Strengths:**
- Clean card-based layout with clear section separation
- Read-only mode for non-owners with explanatory text
- Danger zone is visually distinct (destructive color title, separate card)
- Delete confirmation dialog with clear warning text
- Loading states on save and delete actions
- State syncs when user switches organizations

**Issues:**

- **[CRITICAL] No navigation to get here.** There is no sidebar, breadcrumbs, or persistent navigation for the org section. The only way to reach this page is through the UserMenu dropdown. Users cannot easily navigate between `/org/settings` and `/org/members` -- they must go back to the dropdown each time.

- **[IMPORTANT] No form dirty state tracking.** Users can navigate away from unsaved changes without warning. The save button is always enabled even when nothing has changed.

- **[IMPORTANT] Slug field has no validation feedback.** Slugs have format requirements (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces) but there is no real-time validation or helper text explaining the format.

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] Delete dialog lacks a type-to-confirm pattern.** For destructive operations affecting all org data, best practice (GitHub, Vercel) is to require the user to type the organization name to confirm deletion.

### 8. Organization Members (`/org/members`)

**Purpose:** View/manage members, change roles, invite new members, manage invitations.

**Strengths:**
- Clear table layout for both members and pending invitations
- Role badges with color-coded variants (owner/admin/member)
- Inline role change via `Select` dropdown for admins
- Invite dialog with email + role selection
- Invitation revocation capability
- Conditional UI based on permissions (canManage)
- Empty states for both members and invitations

**Issues:**

- **[CRITICAL] No confirmation dialog for member removal.** Clicking "Remove" immediately removes the member with no confirmation. This is a destructive action that should require confirmation. The i18n even has a `org_members_remove_confirm` key defined but it is not used in the UI.

- **[IMPORTANT] No search or filter for members.** For organizations with many members, there is no way to search by name or email. The table renders all members at once.

- **[IMPORTANT] No pagination.** All members are rendered in a single list. For large organizations, this will be a performance and usability problem.

- **[IMPORTANT] Date format is locale-dependent but uses `toLocaleDateString()` without options.** The output varies by browser locale and may not match the user's preferred format or the app's selected locale.

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] Raw HTML table instead of a proper data table component.** The members and invitations tables are built with raw `&lt;table>` elements. The codebase already has TanStack Table in the demo section. Using it here would add sorting, searching, and pagination for free.

### 9. Design System Page (`/design-system`)

**Purpose:** Interactive component playground with live theme customization.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent tab-based organization (Colors, Typography, Spacing, Components, Compositions)
- Full keyboard navigation on tabs (ArrowLeft/ArrowRight)
- Proper ARIA roles (tablist, tab, tabpanel)
- Live theme editor sidebar with preset selection and custom color picking
- Theme persistence via localStorage
- FOUC prevention via inline `ThemeScript`
- Comprehensive component showcase with interactive prop controls
- Real-world composition examples (Auth Forms, Data Display, Feedback Patterns)
- Screen reader announcements via `&lt;output aria-live="polite">`

**Issues:**

- **[IMPORTANT] Not internationalized.** All labels are hardcoded in English ("Colors", "Typography", "Components", "Design System", "Click me", etc.) while the rest of the app uses i18n message keys. This is inconsistent with the rest of the application.

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] Theme changes are global and persistent.** A user experimenting with the theme editor can accidentally change the theme for their entire session. There is no "preview only" mode. The reset button exists but is not prominent enough.

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] ComponentShowcase prop controls lack type safety.** There is a `TODO(#90)` comment noting that preview props are `Record&lt;string, unknown>` and need proper typing.

### 10. Demo Pages (`/demo/*`)

**Purpose:** Interactive examples showcasing the tech stack.

**Strengths:**
- Well-organized index page with category grouping (TanStack, Forms, SSR, i18n)
- Each demo is self-contained with consistent layout (centered, title, subtitle)
- Feature-gated behind `VITE_ENABLE_DEMO` -- does not appear in production
- Comprehensive coverage: Store, Query, Table, Forms (simple, address, multi-step), SSR modes, Server Functions, API Request, i18n

**Issues:**

- **[IMPORTANT] Not internationalized.** All demo page titles, descriptions, and content are in English only. While demos are developer-facing, this is inconsistent with the i18n-first approach of the rest of the app.

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] No "back to demos" navigation within individual demo pages.** Users must use the browser back button or the header navigation. A breadcrumb or back link would improve navigation.

### 11. Documentation Pages (`/docs/*`)

**Purpose:** Fumadocs-powered documentation site.

**Strengths:**
- Full sidebar navigation via Fumadocs DocsLayout
- Error boundary with recovery options (Try again, Back to Documentation)
- Proper head metadata (title, description) from frontmatter
- SSR with server functions for page tree loading
- Suspense boundary for client-side content loading
- Separate layout that hides the main Header (uses Fumadocs own nav)

**Issues:**

- **[IMPORTANT] Transition between main site and docs is jarring.** The docs pages use a completely different navigation system (Fumadocs layout with its own header) that replaces the main app Header. Users switching between docs and app pages experience a complete visual context switch. The docs header shows "Roxabi Boilerplate" while the main header shows "Roxabi".

- **[NICE-TO-HAVE] Docs link in the main header uses `&lt;a href="/docs">` instead of TanStack `&lt;Link>`.** This causes a full page reload when navigating to/from docs, which is noticeable as a flash of unstyled content.

## User Flow Analysis

### Flow 1: First-Time Visitor

```
Landing Page → Read features → Click "Get Started" → Docs
                              → Click "GitHub" → External repo
```

**Assessment:** The landing page effectively communicates value, but the "Get Started" flow goes to generic docs rather than a quickstart guide. There is no interactive demo or preview accessible from the landing page.

### Flow 2: Registration + Onboarding

```
Landing Page → Click "Sign Up" → Register → Enter details → Submit
→ See "Check your email" message → Leave to check email
→ Click verification link → Verify Email page → Click "Continue to app"
→ Landing Page (no dashboard) → ??? (dead end)
```

**Assessment: This is the most critical flow failure.** After registration and email verification, the user is dumped back on the marketing landing page with no guidance on what to do next. There is no:
- Onboarding wizard
- Dashboard or home screen
- Organization creation prompt
- First-steps guide

The user must discover the OrgSwitcher in the header to create their first organization, then navigate to org settings/members from the UserMenu dropdown. This is a severe discoverability problem.

### Flow 3: Login (Returning User)

```
Click "Sign In" → Login page → Enter credentials → Submit
→ Toast "Signed in successfully" → Redirect to Landing Page
```

**Assessment:** The redirect to `/` after login is the core problem. Returning users expect to land on a dashboard or their last-used context, not a marketing page.

### Flow 4: Organization Management

```
Header → OrgSwitcher dropdown → Select org (or create new)
Header → UserMenu → "Organization Settings" → Org Settings page
Header → UserMenu → "Members" → Members page
```

**Assessment:** Organization management is buried behind two levels of navigation (avatar click > dropdown item). There is no sidebar, no breadcrumbs, and no way to navigate between settings and members without going back to the header dropdown. This is far below the standard set by Vercel (sidebar), Linear (sidebar), or Stripe (tabs + breadcrumbs).

### Flow 5: Password Reset

```
Login → "Forgot password?" → Reset Password page → Enter email → Submit
→ Success message → Check email → Click link
→ Set New Password page → Enter password → Submit
→ Toast "Password updated" → Redirect to Login
```

**Assessment:** This flow is well-executed. The two-step process is clear, error states are handled, and the redirect back to login is logical.

### Flow 6: Magic Link Sign-In

```
Login → Enter email in magic link field → Click "Send"
→ Magic Link Sent page → Check email → Click link → Auto sign-in
→ Landing Page (same problem as other sign-in flows)
```

**Assessment:** The magic link flow up to sign-in is well-designed with the cooldown timer. The post-sign-in experience has the same "no dashboard" problem.

## Benchmark Against Modern SaaS Standards

### Compared to Vercel Dashboard
- **Missing:** Persistent sidebar navigation, breadcrumbs, dashboard overview, project list, deployment status, team management with tabs
- **Present:** Theme toggle, responsive header, clean auth

### Compared to Linear
- **Missing:** Command palette (Cmd+K), sidebar with organized sections, keyboard-first navigation, persistent workspace context
- **Present:** Clean typography, card-based layouts

### Compared to Stripe Dashboard
- **Missing:** Breadcrumb navigation, search, notification center, activity feed, multi-step onboarding, inline documentation
- **Present:** Clean form patterns, toast notifications, destructive action patterns

### Common SaaS Patterns Missing from Roxabi
1. **Dashboard / Home screen** -- Every SaaS has one
2. **Sidebar navigation** -- Standard for multi-section apps
3. **Breadcrumbs** -- Essential for nested routes
4. **Command palette (Cmd+K)** -- Expected by developer-focused tools
5. **Search** -- Global search across resources
6. **User profile/settings** -- Personal settings separate from org
7. **Notification system** -- In-app notifications
8. **Onboarding wizard** -- Guided first-time experience

---

## Prioritized Recommendations

### CRITICAL -- Blocks Users or Causes Confusion

**C1. Create an authenticated dashboard/home screen**
- **Problem:** After login, users land on the marketing page with no next step
- **Impact:** Every authenticated user hits this dead end
- **Fix:** Create `/dashboard` route that shows after login with: welcome message, organization overview, quick actions (create org, invite members, view docs)
- **Files:** New route at `apps/web/src/routes/dashboard.tsx`, update redirect targets in login/register/verify-email routes

**C2. Add confirmation dialog for member removal**
- **Problem:** Clicking "Remove" instantly removes a member with no undo
- **Impact:** Accidental member removal is irreversible
- **Fix:** Add a `Dialog` confirmation before calling `handleRemoveMember()`. The i18n key `org_members_remove_confirm` already exists but is unused
- **File:** `/home/mickael/projects/roxabi_boilerplate/apps/web/src/routes/org/members.tsx` (line 260-264)

**C3. Add persistent navigation for org management**
- **Problem:** No way to navigate between org pages without going through header dropdowns
- **Impact:** Org management feels disconnected and hidden
- **Fix:** Add a sidebar or tab navigation component for the `/org/*` routes with links to Settings, Members, and future sections (Billing, Audit Log). Consider a layout route at `/org` that wraps child routes with this navigation.

### IMPORTANT -- Significantly Degrades Experience

**I1. Post-registration success state**
- **Problem:** After registration, the form remains visible with filled fields alongside a success message
- **Fix:** Replace the form with a dedicated success view (mail icon, email address, "Check your inbox" message, resend link)

**I2. Improve magic link placement on login page**
- **Problem:** Magic link section is visually subordinate and confusing in the form hierarchy
- **Fix:** Either create a tabbed interface (Password | Magic Link) for the primary form, or give the magic link its own visually distinct card section with a heading

**I3. Add real-time form validation**
- **Problem:** No inline validation on email format, password requirements, slug format
- **Fix:** Add field-level validation with helper text. The `PasswordInput` already has `showStrength` -- extend this pattern to email (format check) and slug (format requirements shown as helper text)

**I4. Internationalize the design system page**
- **Problem:** Design system uses hardcoded English while the rest of the app is fully i18n
- **Fix:** Add i18n message keys for all design system labels and use `m.*()` calls

**I5. Internationalize demo pages**
- **Problem:** Demo pages use hardcoded English titles and descriptions
- **Fix:** Add i18n message keys for demo content

**I6. Add Footer to all pages**
- **Problem:** Footer only appears on the landing page
- **Fix:** Move `&lt;Footer />` into the `AppShell` component in `__root.tsx` so it appears on all non-docs pages, or at minimum on all public-facing pages

**I7. Improve docs/app navigation transition**
- **Problem:** Switching between main app and docs is a jarring context switch with different headers
- **Fix:** Use TanStack `&lt;Link>` for the docs navigation link in the header to avoid full page reloads. Consider adding the main header's theme/locale controls to the docs layout for consistency.

**I8. Add dirty-state tracking to org settings form**
- **Problem:** Users can navigate away from unsaved changes without warning
- **Fix:** Track form dirty state, disable save button when unchanged, and warn on navigation with unsaved changes

**I9. Add search and pagination to members table**
- **Problem:** All members rendered in a flat list with no search, filter, or pagination
- **Fix:** Use TanStack Table (already in the codebase via the demo) for the members and invitations tables

### NICE-TO-HAVE -- Polish and Delight

**N1. Add loading spinners to submit buttons**
- Use an animated spinner icon alongside the loading text for all form submit buttons

**N2. Add type-to-confirm for organization deletion**
- Require the user to type the organization name before the delete button becomes active

**N3. Add email provider deeplinks on magic-link-sent page**
- Show "Open Gmail", "Open Outlook" buttons based on the email domain

**N4. Add "back to demos" breadcrumb on individual demo pages**
- Simple breadcrumb: Demos > Store, Demos > Table, etc.

**N5. Add social proof to landing page**
- GitHub stars count, user testimonials, or logo bar

**N6. Make feature cards on landing page clickable**
- Link each feature card to its relevant documentation section

**N7. Add password confirmation field on registration**
- Standard pattern for new account creation

**N8. Add a command palette (Cmd+K)**
- Developer-focused SaaS products universally expect this

**N9. Add rate limiting feedback on reset password page**
- Add a cooldown timer similar to the magic link page

**N10. Improve error message specificity**
- Differentiate between "invalid credentials", "account not verified", and "account locked" with specific messages and recovery actions

**N11. Add slug auto-generation from organization name**
- When the user types an org name, auto-suggest a slug (kebab-case, lowercase)

**N12. Add user profile/settings page**
- Personal settings (name, email, avatar, password change) separate from organization settings

---

## Summary

The Roxabi Boilerplate web application has a **solid foundation** with well-implemented auth flows, clean UI components, proper accessibility patterns, and good i18n coverage. The shadcn/ui-based design system is polished and the component library is well-structured.

The **critical gap** is the absence of any authenticated experience beyond organization management pages. The application currently has no dashboard, no onboarding flow, and no sense of "home" for authenticated users. This is the single most impactful improvement that would transform the product from a collection of auth pages into a usable SaaS boilerplate.

Secondary priorities should focus on improving navigation for authenticated sections (sidebar, breadcrumbs), adding the missing confirmation dialog for member removal, and achieving full i18n consistency across all pages.

The codebase demonstrates strong engineering practices (error boundaries, ARIA, i18n, loading states, responsive design) that provide a solid base for these improvements. Most of the recommendations involve adding missing screens and patterns rather than fixing broken ones.
