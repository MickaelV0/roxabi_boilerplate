title: "Analysis: Claude Code & Agent Teams Presentation Page"
description: Analysis for a standalone web presentation page introducing Claude Code, its development workflow, and Agent Teams coordination.
---

## Problem Statement

Roxabi needs a **standalone presentation-style web page** for a ~30-minute talk introducing audiences to Claude Code, its usage patterns, and Agent Teams coordination. This is NOT a slide deck exported to HTML — it is a purpose-built web page that acts as a visual companion to a live presentation.

The page will showcase Roxabi's real-world experience with Claude Code across **808 sessions, 680 hours of compute, and 624 commits** — providing concrete evidence that AI-assisted development at scale is practical and productive.

**Why a web page instead of slides:**

- Live code examples with syntax highlighting and typing animations
- Interactive elements (expandable sections, hover details on agents)
- Shareable URL that works as both presentation support and standalone reading material
- Consistent with Roxabi's web-first approach (TanStack Start, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)

## Target Audience

| Segment | What they care about | Level of detail |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Developers** (primary) | How to set up and use Claude Code daily | High — show configs, aliases, CLAUDE.md |
| **Tech leads** | Process governance, review pipeline, quality gates | Medium — show tiers, review flow, metrics |
| **CTOs / Engineering managers** | ROI, team velocity, risk mitigation | Low — show stats, completion rate, pipeline overview |

The page must work for mixed audiences — progressive disclosure (overview first, details on scroll/expand) is the right pattern.

---

## Content Structure

7 sections, designed for a ~30-minute sequential walkthrough:

### Section 1: Introduction — What is Claude Code

**Goal:** Set context in 2-3 minutes.

- What Claude Code is: CLI-based agentic coding assistant with filesystem access
- How it differs from ChatGPT/Copilot: not autocomplete, it is an autonomous agent
- Key stat: 808 sessions, 88% task completion rate
- Visual: terminal mockup showing Claude Code in action

### Section 2: Prerequisites &amp; Setup

**Goal:** Show the practical environment in 3-4 minutes.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| tmux | Multi-pane terminal sessions (agents run in parallel panes) |
| WezTerm | GPU-accelerated terminal with WSL2 support |
| Starship | Fast, informative prompt (git branch, runtime versions) |
| Aliases | `cc`, `ccc`, `cc-front`, `cc-back`, `cc-test`, `cc-pa` |
| Env vars | `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` |

- Visual: annotated terminal screenshot showing tmux panes with multiple agents
- Code block: `.bash_aliases` snippet

### Section 3: Core Building Blocks

**Goal:** Explain the foundation in 5 minutes.

| Block | Description | Count |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| CLAUDE.md | Project-level instructions file — the "constitution" for all agents | 1 file |
| Skills | Reusable slash commands (`/commit`, `/review`, `/bootstrap`, etc.) | 17 skills |
| Hooks | Auto-format on save, security warnings, git pre-commit/push | 3 hooks |
| Agent definitions | Role-specific `.md` files in `.claude/agents/` | 9 agents |

- Visual: file tree diagram of `.claude/` directory
- Code block: excerpt from CLAUDE.md (critical rules section)

### Section 4: Development Process by Tiers

**Goal:** Show the governance model in 4-5 minutes.

```
Tier S (Quick Fix)    ──── &lt;=3 files, no arch risk      ──── Worktree + PR
Tier F-lite (Feature) ──── Clear scope, single domain    ──── Worktree + agents + /review
Tier F-full (Complex) ──── New arch, unclear requirements ──── Bootstrap + worktree + agents + /review
```

- Visual: decision flowchart (text-based, styled)
- Key insight: file count does NOT determine tier — a 50-file mechanical change may be F-lite, a 3-file rate limiter may be F-full
- Stats: 624 commits across 808 sessions, 12,110 Bash tool calls, 3,647 Edit tool calls

### Section 5: Agent Teams

**Goal:** Deep dive into multi-agent coordination in 5-6 minutes.

**9 agents in 3 categories:**

| Category | Agents | Role |
|----------|--------|------|
| Domain (code writers) | frontend-dev, backend-dev, devops | Implement within boundaries |
| Quality (verification) | tester, fixer, security-auditor | Test, fix, audit |
| Strategy (planning) | architect, product-lead, doc-writer | Design, align, document |

**Routing decision tree** — visual representation of when to use subagents vs full teams.

**Coordination primitives:**
- Shared task list (TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskList)
- Direct messaging (SendMessage)
- Blocking dependencies (blockedBy)
- Fresh reviewer pattern (no agent reviews code it wrote)

### Section 6: Test-First &amp; Review Pipeline

**Goal:** Show the quality engine in 4-5 minutes.

**RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle:**
1. Tester writes failing tests from spec (RED)
2. Domain agents implement to pass tests (GREEN)
3. Refactor while keeping tests green (REFACTOR)

**Review pipeline:**
1. `/review` spawns fresh review agents (never the authors)
2. Each produces Conventional Comments scoped to their domain
3. `/1b1` walks human through each finding (accept/reject/defer)
4. Parallel fixers apply accepted fixes by domain

- Visual: pipeline diagram showing the 4-phase flow
- Key insight: "Human decides, Claude orchestrates, agents specialize"

### Section 7: End-to-End Example

**Goal:** Tie everything together in 5-6 minutes.

Walk through a real feature from idea to production:

```
/bootstrap (idea to spec)
    |
/scaffold (spec to PR)
    |
/review (fresh agents review)
    |
/pr (create pull request)
    |
/promote (staging to main)
```

- Visual: animated flow showing each stage with example output
- Stats callout: 88% task completion rate, 991 AskUserQuestion calls (human-in-the-loop)

## Technical Approach (with Architect Recommendations)

> The following recommendations incorporate input from the architect agent. All decisions stay within the existing tech stack with zero new dependencies.

### Route Structure

**Decision: `/talks/claude-code`** with a `talks.tsx` layout route.

- Namespaced for future presentations (`/talks/agent-teams`, `/talks/tanstack-deep-dive`)
- Clear semantic meaning — this is a talk, not a product page
- `/presentation/` is too verbose, `/claude-code` is too flat (collides with potential product pages)

File structure:

```
src/routes/
├── talks.tsx                    # Layout route (full-screen shell, renders <Outlet />)
├── talks/
│   └── claude-code.tsx          # The presentation route (composes sections)
```

The layout route `talks.tsx` handles full-screen chrome (same pattern as `demo.tsx` for demo routes). Child routes render via `&lt;Outlet />`.

### Layout Approach

**Decision: Full-screen, no Header, extend existing AppShell pattern.**

The `__root.tsx` AppShell already conditionally hides the Header for `/docs`. Extend the same check:

```tsx
// In __root.tsx AppShell
const isDocsPage = pathname.startsWith('/docs')
const isTalksPage = pathname.startsWith('/talks')
// ...
{!isDocsPage && !isTalksPage && <Header />}
```

The `talks.tsx` layout route then provides its own minimal chrome:
- Fixed section indicator (dots on the right side)
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys for scroll-snap sections)
- A small "back to site" link in the corner
- Full viewport sections (`min-h-screen` + scroll-snap per section)

### Component Architecture

**Decision: `components/presentation/` directory** (follows the `components/landing/` pattern).

The landing page pattern (`index.tsx` + `components/landing/`) is the closest analog — multiple visual sections composed into one page. This is preferred over route-private `-components/` because the 7 sections are substantial standalone components.

```
src/components/presentation/
├── IntroSection.tsx              # Section 1: What is Claude Code
├── SetupSection.tsx              # Section 2: Prerequisites & setup
├── BuildingBlocksSection.tsx     # Section 3: CLAUDE.md, Skills, Hooks, Agents
├── DevProcessSection.tsx         # Section 4: Tiers S / F-lite / F-full
├── AgentTeamsSection.tsx         # Section 5: 9 agents, routing tree
├── TestReviewSection.tsx         # Section 6: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR, review flow
├── EndToEndSection.tsx           # Section 7: /bootstrap → /scaffold → /review → /pr
├── PresentationNav.tsx           # Side dots + keyboard nav + progress bar
├── CodeBlock.tsx                 # Styled code block with optional typing animation
├── StatCounter.tsx               # Animated number counter component
└── SectionContainer.tsx          # Full-viewport wrapper (min-h-screen + scroll-snap)
```

The route file `talks/claude-code.tsx` stays thin — just imports and composes:

```tsx
function ClaudeCodePresentation() {
  return (
    <div className="snap-y snap-mandatory overflow-y-auto h-screen">
      <PresentationNav sections={SECTIONS} />
      <SectionContainer id="intro"><IntroSection /></SectionContainer>
      <SectionContainer id="setup"><SetupSection /></SectionContainer>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Animation Approach

**Decision: Pure CSS + IntersectionObserver. No Framer Motion.**

- Zero new dependencies — Framer Motion is ~33KB gzipped, overkill for scroll reveals and typing
- `tailwindcss-animate` is already installed — provides `animate-in`, `fade-in`, `slide-in-from-bottom` via Tailwind classes
- Existing `AnimatedSection` pattern proven in the landing page

**Specific implementations:**

| Animation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Scroll-triggered reveals | Extend `AnimatedSection` with direction variants (fade-up, fade-left, scale-in). Stagger children with Tailwind `delay-*` classes |
| Code block typing | CSS `@keyframes` with `steps()` — `width: 0` to `width: 100%` with overflow hidden, triggered by IntersectionObserver |
| Stat counters | `StatCounter` component (~20 lines) using `requestAnimationFrame` count-up, triggered by IntersectionObserver |
| Section transitions | CSS `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory` + `scroll-snap-align: start` on each section. Combined with `scroll-behavior: smooth` |
| Reduced motion | All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — follow existing pattern from `AnimatedSection` and `styles.css` |

### Option B Considered and Rejected: Framer Motion

| Factor | Pure CSS (chosen) | Framer Motion (rejected) |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Bundle impact | 0 KB | +33 KB gzipped |
| New dependency | No | Yes |
| Pattern consistency | Extends existing `AnimatedSection` | New paradigm |
| Capability | Sufficient for all 5 animation types | Overkill |

## Real Metrics to Include

From the [Claude Code Usage Insights](./claude-code-usage-insights) analysis:

| Metric | Value | Visual treatment |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Sessions | 808 | Animated counter |
| Messages | 6,572 | Animated counter |
| Compute hours | 680h | Animated counter |
| Commits | 624 | Animated counter |
| Task completion rate | 88% | Large percentage with ring chart |
| Bash tool calls | 12,110 | Stat card |
| Edit tool calls | 3,647 | Stat card |
| AskUserQuestion calls | 991 | Stat card (human-in-the-loop emphasis) |
| Period | 16 days | Context label |
| Overall satisfaction | 88% | Badge/highlight |

**Standout example to feature:** "19 PR review fixes across 4 parallel agents touching 30 files in a single session"

## Visual Direction

### Design Principles

1. **Dark-first** — Presentation pages work best on dark backgrounds (projector-friendly, terminal aesthetic)
2. **Terminal aesthetic** — Monospace fonts for code, green-on-dark for terminal mockups
3. **Progressive reveal** — Each section fades in as you scroll, with staggered child elements
4. **High contrast stats** — Large numbers in bold with accent colors
5. **Minimal chrome** — No sidebar, no footer, no distractions

### Color Strategy

- Background: dark variant of the theme (`bg-background` in dark mode, forced)
- Accent: primary color for highlights, stat numbers, and interactive elements
- Code blocks: slightly lighter background with syntax highlighting
- Agent cards: color-coded borders matching agent definitions (cyan for frontend-dev, green for backend-dev, etc.)

### Typography

- Headings: bold, large (`text-4xl` to `text-6xl`)
- Body: readable size (`text-lg` to `text-xl`) — larger than normal pages since this is a presentation
- Code: monospace (`font-mono`), generous line height
- Stats: extra large (`text-5xl` to `text-7xl`) with font-weight bold

### Inspiration

- GitHub Universe keynote pages
- Vercel's product pages (clean, dark, animated stats)
- Stripe's documentation (clear code blocks, progressive disclosure)

---

## Scope &amp; Tier Classification

**Tier: F-lite**

- Single domain: frontend only (`apps/web/`)
- No backend changes, no new packages
- Clear requirements (7 sections defined, content sourced from existing docs)
- No new architectural concepts (extends existing patterns: routes, components, CSS animations)

**Estimated size: M (1-2 days)**

- 1 route file + 10-12 component files
- 2-3 custom hooks (typing animation, counter, keyboard nav)
- CSS additions for presentation-specific styles
- No i18n needed (English-only presentation)

---

## Open Questions

1. **Keyboard navigation scope** — Should arrow keys navigate between sections (full-page scroll snap) or just be a nice-to-have alongside normal scrolling?
2. **Print/export** — Should the page be printable as a handout? (Affects layout decisions)
3. **Dark mode enforcement** — Force dark theme on this page regardless of user preference, or respect the toggle?

---

## Dependencies

- Existing `AnimatedSection` component
- Existing `@repo/ui` components (Card, Badge, Button)
- `lucide-react` icons
- Content from: `docs/guides/agent-teams.mdx`, `docs/processes/dev-process.mdx`

No new npm packages required.
