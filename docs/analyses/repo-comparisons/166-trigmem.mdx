## Detailed Analysis

### 1. What It Does 🟢

TrigMem is a pure methodology for organizing Claude Code's AI context. Created by Arno Trigallez in
February 2026, it targets developers who use Claude Code daily and struggle with a consistent, deliberate
answer to the question "where does this information belong?"

The value proposition is direct: eliminate the cognitive overhead of deciding whether something goes in
`CLAUDE.md`, a Rule, a Skill, or a Command. It defines six information categories and five storage
mechanisms, then provides a two-phase decision process (triage → refinement) to route any piece of
knowledge to the right location.

**Problem it solves that roxabi has not fully documented:**
- Roxabi's `CLAUDE.md` is ~200+ lines and growing. TrigMem provides a principled argument for why
  that is costly and what to do about it.
- Roxabi mixes project-specific instructions and portable skill procedures within the same CLAUDE.md
  without explicit categorization.

### 2. How It Works 🟢

The methodology flows through seven sequential chapters:

1. **Theory** — the "Impossible Triangle" of Context Economy vs. Precision vs. Reusability
2. **What You're Storing** — 6 information categories (Project Identity, Codebase Structure,
   Operational Commands, Reusable Patterns, Architectural Guidance, Iterative Corrections)
3. **Storage Options** — 5 mechanisms (CLAUDE.md, Rules, Skills, Commands, Sub-agents) with
   "when loaded" semantics and anti-patterns for each
4. **Two-Phase Decision Guide** — 4 triage questions; for each "yes" a Phase 2 refinement section
5. **CLAUDE.md Best Practices** — quantitative token budget tables, the Pointer Pattern
6. **Migration Guide** — step-by-step process to audit and refactor existing CLAUDE.md files
7. **Configurable Skills** — separating universal "how" from project-specific "where" via YAML config

Key insight: the Phase 1 triage questions are designed so the first "yes" stops evaluation — a
decision tree rather than a checklist. This makes the process fast (~30 seconds per item).

The worked examples in `examples/worked-examples.md` use `<details>` collapse blocks to let readers
attempt a decision before seeing the answer — an effective pedagogical technique.

### 3. Architecture & Layers ⚪

Not applicable — this is a methodology documentation project with no software layers, APIs, or
domain model. The "architecture" is the conceptual framework itself (6 categories × 5 mechanisms
mapped via a decision flowchart).

### 4. File / Project Structure 🟢

```
/
├── 01-theory.md                    # Chapter 1
├── 02-what-youre-storing.md        # Chapter 2
├── 03-storage-options.md           # Chapter 3
├── 04-two-phase-decision-guide.md  # Chapter 4
├── 05-claudemd-best-practices.md   # Chapter 5
├── 06-migration-guide.md           # Chapter 6
├── 07-configurable-skills.md       # Chapter 7
├── examples/

├── docs/                           # Symlink mirrors for MkDocs
├── mkdocs.yml
├── requirements.txt
├── .github/workflows/deploy.yml
└── README.md
```

**What's notable:**

- Sequential numeric prefixing enforces a canonical reading order and avoids "where do I start?"
  confusion. Roxabi's `docs/` uses descriptive slug names but no enforced order.
- The `docs/` folder contains symlinks or shallow stubs pointing to the root `.md` files, letting
  MkDocs serve from `docs_dir: docs` while the sources remain in the root — a pragmatic choice for
  a pure-documentation repo.
- The dual `examples/` (both root and inside `docs/`) structure suggests the MkDocs source-mirroring
  pattern is still being refined.

### 5. Tech Stack & Tooling ⚪

TrigMem is intentionally a zero-runtime-dependency project:

| Layer | TrigMem | roxabi_boilerplate |
|-------|---------|--------------------|
| Runtime | None | Bun 1.3.9 |
| Framework | MkDocs Material (Python) | TanStack Start + NestJS |
| Language | Markdown | TypeScript 5.x strict |
| Linter | None | Biome 2.x |
| Package manager | pip | Bun workspaces |
| Doc site | MkDocs + GitHub Pages | TanStack Start / Nitro |

The only tooling is MkDocs with Material theme (Python), `requirements.txt` contains only
`mkdocs-material`. This is appropriate for the project's purpose.

**MkDocs Material** is worth noting as a documentation hosting choice. It provides instant
navigation, dark/light toggle, full-text search, Mermaid diagram support, and a polished reading
experience — all without any JavaScript framework.

### 6. Developer Experience (DX) 🟡

For contributors to the methodology:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt && mkdocs serve` gives a live-reloading local doc server
- No `.env` management, no DB, no secrets — zero friction to start
- No `CONTRIBUTING.md` or onboarding guide beyond the README

For consumers (developers adopting TrigMem):

- The numbered chapter structure is clear and self-guided
- Worked examples with collapsible solutions provide a learning loop
- No tooling installation required to read or apply the method

DX is rated 🟡 because while it's frictionless for a docs repo, there is no CLI tooling, no
interactive decision wizard, and no VS Code extension — all of which would elevate adoption.

### 7. Testing Strategy 🔴

No tests. This is expected for a pure-documentation methodology project. The "tests" are the worked
examples themselves, which verify the decision framework produces consistent outcomes.

Roxabi has Vitest unit tests, Playwright e2e, and coverage enforcement on pre-push — not comparable.

### 8. CI/CD Pipelines 🔴

Single workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

- No lint step, no link checker, no spell checker
- No branch protection — direct pushes to `master` deploy immediately
- No staging/preview environments
- `--force` on `gh-deploy` overwrites the `gh-pages` branch without review

By contrast, roxabi has three workflows (`ci.yml`, `deploy-preview.yml`, `neon-cleanup.yml`) with
separate staging and production pipelines, turbo-ignore for affected-only builds, and Neon branch
management per PR.

### 9. Documentation Quality 🟢

This is TrigMem's primary deliverable — and it is excellent relative to what most methodology repos
provide:

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| README | Clear problem/solution framing, version history, author attribution |
| Chapter depth | Each of 7 chapters covers theory + examples + anti-patterns |
| Decision tools | Flowchart (Mermaid), decision tables, comparison tables |
| Worked examples | 6 scenarios with self-test collapse blocks |
| Migration guide | Step-by-step audit checklist for existing CLAUDE.md files |
| Hosted site | MkDocs Material with navigation, search, dark mode |
| Contributing | Missing — no CONTRIBUTING.md |
| Changelog | Inline in README (version history section); no dedicated CHANGELOG.md |
| Versioning | Semantic-ish (0.1.3 Alpha) but no release tags or GitHub Releases |

The absence of a `CONTRIBUTING.md` and formal changelog is notable given the project's educational
purpose. roxabi has both (`docs/contributing.mdx`, `CHANGELOG.md`).

### 10. Unique / Novel Ideas 🟢

Several ideas in TrigMem have direct applicability to roxabi and 2ndBrain:

**1. The Impossible Triangle**

The explicit framing of Context Economy vs. Precision vs. Reusability as three competing forces is
a novel mental model. Most teams optimize for precision alone (cramming detail into CLAUDE.md) and
discover the token cost problem later. Naming the triangle makes the trade-off deliberate.

**2. Quantitative Token Budget Tables**

Section 5 includes tables showing tokens-per-conversation for different CLAUDE.md sizes:

```
| CLAUDE.md Size | 10 Messages | 50 Messages | 100 Messages |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| 100 tokens     | 1,000       | 5,000       | 10,000       |
| 500 tokens     | 5,000       | 25,000      | 50,000       |
| 2,000 tokens   | 20,000      | 100,000     | 200,000      |
```

This makes the cost of bloated CLAUDE.md files visceral. Neither roxabi nor 2ndBrain has
documented this constraint.

**3. The Pointer Pattern**

CLAUDE.md as a "table of contents, not the book" — brief references pointing to Skills/Rules for
details. roxabi's CLAUDE.md already uses this pattern partially (links to `docs/` pages) but
TrigMem names and formalizes it.

**4. Configurable Skills**

Separating the universal "how" (skill logic) from the project-specific "where" (YAML config) to
make skills portable across projects. This is marked experimental in TrigMem but the concept is
sound. roxabi's skills in `.claude/skills/` currently mix universal patterns with project-specific
paths.

**5. Phase 1 → Phase 2 Decision Flow**

The triage-first, refinement-second structure. Most documentation just gives a table; TrigMem
provides an actual decision procedure. This is more reliable and teachable.

**6. Note for AI Agents vs. Human Readers**

The guide explicitly annotates: "Note for AI Agents: If you're an AI reading this, you can often
decide directly by analyzing the content..." This meta-awareness of dual audiences (human and AI
readers of documentation) is novel and useful for repos that embed docs for both audiences.

### 11. What They Do Better Than roxabi_boilerplate

**1. Explicit token budget reasoning for CLAUDE.md**

TrigMem provides quantitative tables and a 100-200 token target for CLAUDE.md. roxabi's `CLAUDE.md`
is significantly longer than that target. The lack of a documented token budget means CLAUDE.md will
grow unboundedly over time.

**Actionable:** Add a `## Token Budget` section or comment to roxabi's `CLAUDE.md` with a hard
target (e.g., ≤500 tokens for project identity + pointers, full content in `docs/`).

**2. Categorized information model**

TrigMem's 6 categories give a shared vocabulary for discussing what goes where. roxabi has the
structures (CLAUDE.md, Skills, docs/) but no documented classification.

**Actionable:** Adopt the 6-category taxonomy in roxabi's contributing guide to help contributors
know where new documentation belongs.

**3. Configurable Skills pattern**

roxabi skills (`.claude/skills/`) contain project-specific paths. For example, skills referencing
`apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/` would break if the monorepo structure changed or if someone
tried to reuse skills in another project.

**Actionable:** Audit `.claude/skills/` for hardcoded paths and factor them into a project
configuration block at the top of each skill file.

**4. Migration guide concept**

TrigMem documents a step-by-step process to audit and refactor existing CLAUDE.md. roxabi has no
equivalent — contributors can add to `CLAUDE.md` without any audit or rationalization process.

**Actionable:** Create a periodic CLAUDE.md audit checklist (is this still needed? is this in the
right place?) and add it to the contributing guide.

### 12. What They Do Better Than 2ndBrain

**1. Universal vs. project-specific separation**

2ndBrain's `.claude/skills/` mixes project-specific content (Google Drive paths, Telegram bot
configuration, French-language instructions) with potentially portable patterns. TrigMem's
Category 4 vs. Category 5 distinction would help 2ndBrain factor reusable skills from
project-bound ones.

**2. Decision framework for skill creation**

2ndBrain has a `skill-creator` skill but no documented criteria for what should be a skill vs.
what should stay in CLAUDE.md. TrigMem's Phase 1 Q2 ("Is this universal how-to knowledge
portable across projects?") is exactly the question 2ndBrain lacks.

**3. Token economy documentation**

2ndBrain's `CLAUDE.md` is comparable in length to roxabi's. The TrigMem argument about token
costs applies equally to 2ndBrain.

**Alignment with roxabi:** Both projects share the same weaknesses relative to TrigMem — primarily
undocumented token budgets and no formal categorization of stored information. The strengths are
largely the same too: both have structured skill systems and pointer-pattern docs.

### 13. Key Takeaways

**Priority 1 — Must Have**

- **Adopt the Pointer Pattern explicitly.** Document in `docs/contributing.mdx` that `CLAUDE.md`
  is a table of contents pointing to `docs/` pages, not a place for detailed instructions. Enforce
  a token target (≤500 tokens for project-identity + links).

- **Audit skills for hardcoded paths.** Apply the Configurable Skills pattern to `.claude/skills/`
  files that embed `apps/web`, `apps/api`, or other project-specific paths. Add a config block
  comment at the top of each skill file separating universal logic from project-specific values.

**Priority 2 — Should Have**

- **Add the 6-category taxonomy to the contributing guide.** When contributors ask "where does this
  go?", give them a documented answer using TrigMem's vocabulary (even if we rename the categories).

- **Add a CLAUDE.md audit step to the contributing process.** Before adding anything to `CLAUDE.md`,
  the contributor should run through the triage questions: Is it always needed? Is it project
  identity? Could it live in a skill or rule instead?

**Priority 3 — Nice to Have**

- **Add a quantitative token budget table** to the contributing guide showing conversation-level
  cost scaling — makes the argument concrete for future contributors.

- **Consider MkDocs Material** as an alternative or supplement for documentation that requires
  deep navigation and search. The roxabi doc site built on TanStack is more powerful but MkDocs
  is faster to set up for pure documentation repositories.

**Potential GitHub issues to create:**

- `docs: document CLAUDE.md token budget and pointer pattern` — extends `docs/contributing.mdx`
- `chore: audit .claude/skills/ for hardcoded project paths` — applies Configurable Skills pattern
- `docs: add information categorization taxonomy to contributing guide`

## What's next?

TrigMem is a young project (Alpha 0.1.3, created 8 days before last commit) by a single author with
no external contributors yet. Its core ideas are well-articulated and practically useful. The main
limitations are the experimental status of Configurable Skills (no concrete examples yet) and the
absence of any tooling (no CLI, no VS Code extension, no linter).

The most immediately applicable idea for roxabi is the **Pointer Pattern + token budget discipline**.
roxabi's CLAUDE.md already uses pointers but without an explicit budget, making it prone to gradual
bloat. Formalizing the pattern in `docs/contributing.mdx` costs one day of documentation work and
has indefinite value for all future contributors.
