## Issue Lifecycle

```
Create → Triage → Prioritize → Assign → Implement → Review → Close
```

---

## Creating Issues

### From Templates

Use the provided GitHub templates:

- **Bug Report**: For reporting bugs with reproduction steps
- **Feature Request**: For proposing new features

### Minimum Requirements

Every issue should have:

- Clear, actionable title
- Description with context and acceptance criteria
- Related issues linked (if any)

---

## Triage

Triage ensures every issue has a **Size** and **Priority** assigned.

### Size

| Size | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **XS** | Trivial change, &lt;1 hour | Typo fix, config tweak |
| **S** | Small task, &lt;4 hours | Single file change, simple feature |
| **M** | Medium task, 1-2 days | Multi-file feature, requires testing |
| **L** | Large task, 3-5 days | Complex feature, architectural changes |
| **XL** | Very large, >1 week | Major refactor, new system |

### Priority

| Priority | Label | Description | Action |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Urgent** | `P0` | Blocking or critical | Do immediately |
| **High** | `P1` | Important for current milestone | Do this sprint |
| **Medium** | `P2` | Should be done soon | Plan for next sprint |
| **Low** | `P3` | Nice to have | Backlog |

### Triage Process

Use the `/issue-triage` skill to identify and label untriaged issues:

```bash
# List issues missing Size or Priority
.claude/skills/issue-triage/triage.sh list

# Set values
.claude/skills/issue-triage/triage.sh set 42 --size M --priority High
```

## Blockers & Dependencies

### Adding a Blocker

When an issue blocks another:

1. Use GitHub's native `blockedBy` dependency (source of truth):
   ```bash
   # Make #51 blocked by #19
   gh api graphql \
     -F query='mutation($issueId: ID!, $blockingId: ID!) {
       addBlockedBy(input: { issueId: $issueId, blockingIssueId: $blockingId }) {
         issue { number }
         blockingIssue { number }
       }
     }' \
     -f issueId="$(gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/51 --jq '.node_id')" \
     -f blockingId="$(gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/19 --jq '.node_id')"
   ```

2. Add the `blocked` label to the blocked issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <number> --add-label "blocked"
   ```

3. Reference the blocked issue in the blocker's body (e.g., "Blocker for #19")

### Resolving a Blocker

When a blocking issue is closed:

1. Remove the `blocked` label from previously blocked issues:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <number> --remove-label "blocked"
   ```

2. Verify unblocked issues are ready to work on

### Viewing Dependencies

Use the `/issues` skill to see the full dependency graph:

```bash
.claude/skills/issues/fetch_issues.sh
```

The output shows block status for each issue:

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `✅` | Ready — no open blockers |
| `⛔` | Blocked — waiting on other issues |
| `🔓` | Blocking — other issues depend on this |

## Labels

### Priority Labels

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `P0` | Urgent — blocking or critical |
| `P1` | High — current milestone |
| `P2` | Medium — plan soon |
| `P3` | Low — nice to have |

### Size Labels

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `XS` | Trivial change (&lt;1 hour) |
| `S` | Small change (few hours) |
| `M` | Medium change (1-2 days) |
| `L` | Large change (3-5 days) |
| `XL` | Epic (needs breakdown) |

### Type Labels

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `feature` | New functionality |
| `bug` | Something broken |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `dx` | Developer experience |
| `ai` | AI/Agent related |
| `workflow` | Process improvement |
| `setup` | Infrastructure setup |

### Status Labels

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `blocked` | Issue is blocked by another issue |

## Best Practices

- **One issue per concern**: Don't bundle unrelated changes
- **Link related issues**: Use GitHub references (`#42`) and `blockedBy`
- **Close with PR**: Reference the issue in your PR (`Closes #42`)
- **Update status**: Move issues on the project board as work progresses
- **Break down XL**: Issues sized XL should be broken into smaller issues
