# Troubleshooting

Common issues encountered during development and their solutions.

## Database Connection Failures

**Symptom:** `connection refused` or `ECONNREFUSED` errors on port 5432 when starting the API or running migrations.

**Cause:** The PostgreSQL Docker container is not running, or is mapped to a different port than the app expects.

**Fix:** Start the Docker services and verify the container is healthy:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

Confirm the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file matches the port and credentials defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Bun Version Mismatch

**Symptom:** `error: package manager mismatch` during install, or unexpected runtime behavior.

**Cause:** Your local Bun version does not match the `packageManager` field declared in the root `package.json`.

**Fix:** Upgrade Bun to the latest version, or install the exact version the project expects:

```bash
bun upgrade
```

If the project pins a specific version, check `package.json` for the `packageManager` field and install that version.

## Port Already in Use

**Symptom:** `EADDRINUSE` error when starting the dev server or API.

**Cause:** Another process is already listening on port 3000 (web) or 3001 (API).

**Fix:** Kill the process occupying the port, or start on a different port:

```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill
```

Alternatively, set the `PORT` environment variable to use a different port.

## Pre-commit Hook Failures

**Symptom:** Commit is rejected by Lefthook with Biome formatting errors or commitlint violations.

**Cause:** Staged files have formatting issues, or the commit message does not follow the Conventional Commits format.

**Fix:** For formatting issues, run Biome auto-fix across the project:

```bash
bunx biome check --write .
```

For commit message rejections, use the Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(web): add login page`). See the [Contributing guide](/docs/contributing) for the full list of types.

## TypeScript Build Errors After Dependency Updates

**Symptom:** Type errors appear after running `bun install` or updating packages, even though the code has not changed.

**Cause:** Stale `.tsbuildinfo` incremental compilation files or cached type definitions from previous dependency versions.

**Fix:** Clear the build cache and re-run the type checker:

```bash
bun run clean:cache && bun run typecheck
```

## Turbo Cache Staleness

**Symptom:** Build succeeds but your changes do not appear in the output, or Turbo reports "cache hit" for code you just modified.

**Cause:** Turbo's content hash does not capture all inputs (e.g., environment variables or files outside the declared inputs).

**Fix:** Clear the Turbo cache and rebuild:

```bash
bun run clean:cache
```

Or remove the cache directory manually:

```bash
rm -rf .turbo
```

Then run your build command again.
