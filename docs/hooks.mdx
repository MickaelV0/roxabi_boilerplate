description: Guide to Git hooks (Lefthook) and Claude Code hooks configured in Roxabi Boilerplate
---

## Overview

Roxabi Boilerplate uses two layers of hooks: **Lefthook** for Git hooks (commit-msg, pre-commit, pre-push) and **Claude Code hooks** for in-editor automation during development.

## Git Hooks (Lefthook)

[Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) manages Git hooks to enforce code quality at three stages of the Git workflow. Configuration lives in `lefthook.yml` at the repository root.

### Hook Stages

| Stage | Hook | What It Does |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `commit-msg` | **commitlint** | Validates commit messages against the Conventional Commits format |
| `pre-commit` | **biome** | Runs `biome check --write` on staged JS/TS/JSON files, auto-fixes issues, and re-stages the corrected files |
| `pre-push` | **lint** | Runs `bun run lint` (Biome lint on the full repo) |
| `pre-push` | **typecheck** | Runs `bun run typecheck` (TypeScript strict mode) |
| `pre-push` | **test** | Runs `bun run test:coverage` (full test suite with coverage) |
| `pre-push` | **i18n** | Runs `bun run i18n:check` (translation completeness) |
| `pre-push` | **license** | Runs `bun run license:check` (dependency license compliance) |

The `pre-commit` and `pre-push` stages run their commands in parallel for faster execution.

### Installation

Lefthook installs automatically when you run `bun install` thanks to the `prepare` script in `package.json`. To install manually:

```bash
bunx lefthook install
```

### Skipping Hooks

To bypass hooks for a single operation:

```bash
git commit --no-verify
git push --no-verify
```

**Warning:** `--no-verify` skips all hooks for that operation. Use sparingly -- these checks exist to prevent broken code from reaching the remote.

### Pre-commit Auto-fix Behavior

The pre-commit Biome hook runs with `--write` and `stage_fixed: true`. This means if Biome auto-fixes formatting issues in your staged files, the corrected versions are automatically re-staged. You do not need to manually `git add` after a formatting fix.

## Claude Code Hooks

Hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json` automate common tasks during Claude Code development sessions.

### Biome Auto-Format

**Trigger**: After Edit or Write operations on TS/JS files

**Action**: Runs `biome check --write` to format the file

```json
{
  "matcher": "Edit|Write",
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "bunx biome check --write \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS\""
  }]
}
```

### Security Check

**Trigger**: Before Edit or Write operations

**Action**: Scans for security anti-patterns and warns once per file/rule

```json
{
  "matcher": "Edit|Write",
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": ".claude/hooks/security-check.js"
  }]
}
```

## Security Patterns Detected

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| GitHub Actions Injection | Untrusted input in workflow expressions |
| Dynamic Code Execution | `eval()` or `new Function()` |
| XSS Vectors | `innerHTML` or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` |
| Hardcoded Secrets | API keys, passwords in code |
| SQL Injection | Template literal interpolation in queries |
| Command Injection | Template literals in exec/spawn |

## Behavior

- Warnings appear once per file per rule per session
- Warnings don't block operations
- State is persisted in `~/.claude-security-warnings.json`

## Adding Custom Hooks

1. Create hook script in `.claude/hooks/`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x script.js`
3. Add to `.claude/settings.json`

### Hook Script Format

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const input = JSON.parse(process.env.CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT || '{}')

// Your logic here

// Output (optional)
console.log(JSON.stringify({
  decision: 'allow', // or 'block'
  message: 'Optional message to display'
}))
```

## Environment Variables

Available in hooks:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT` | JSON with tool parameters |
| `CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS` | Affected file path(s) |
