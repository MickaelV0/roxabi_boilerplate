# This script runs automatically on first Docker Postgres init
# (mounted to /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/).
#
# The roxabi_app user:
# - Has LOGIN but NOT BYPASSRLS, so RLS policies are enforced
# - Is granted the app_user role (created by migration 0000_rls_infrastructure)
# - Is used by the NestJS application for all runtime queries
#
# The roxabi (superuser) remains the schema owner for migrations only.
